## Experimental Design

### Treatments (8 treatments × 6 replicates = 48 plots)

**Factorial design** testing all combinations of:

1. **Temperature (T)**: +1.5°C soil warming at 2 cm depth
   - Method: Passive nighttime warming curtains (automatic, rolled over vegetation at night)
   - Curtains removed during rain to maintain natural hydrology
   - Target achieved: +1°C average

2. **Drought (D)**: Extended summer drought (5 weeks, late June - early August)
   - Method: Automatic curtains deployed during rain events
   - Soil water content: 5 vol% (drought) vs. 17 vol% (control) at 0-20 cm depth

3. **Elevated CO2**: 510 ppm atmospheric CO2 (ambient ~385 ppm at time)
   - Method: FACE-style pipe fumigation during daylight hours
   - Feedback control system linked to wind speed/direction

**Plot Design**:
- 12 octagons (7 m diameter each)
- Arranged in blocks of 2 (one with CO2, one without)
- Each octagon contained 4 treatment plots (9.2 m² each)

### Measurements

#### 1. Buried Bag Soil Incubations (6 months, winter)

- Three treatments per plot:
  - Soil only
  - Soil + *Deschampsia* seedlings (3 plants, 0.08 g FW each)
  - Soil + *Calluna* seedlings/cuttings (3 plants, 0.05 g FW each)
- Plants pre-grown in site soil for 2-15 months
- Incubation period: November 2006 - May 2007 (187 days)

**Parameters measured**:
- Initial and final soil chemistry

### Litter Decomposition (Ambient Plots)

| Species | Duration | Mass Loss (%) | k (yr⁻¹) |
|---------|----------|---------------|----------|
| *Calluna* | 6 months | 25.8 ± 1.3 | 0.0014 |
| *Calluna* | 12 months | 34.3 ± 1.4 | 0.0011 |
| *Deschampsia* | 6 months | 33.4 ± 1.1 | 0.0019 |
| *Deschampsia* | 12 months | 45.1 ± 4.3 | 0.0017 |
| *Deschampsia* | 14 months | 46.1 ± 4.7 | 0.0014 |

**Note**: *Deschampsia* litter decomposes faster than *Calluna* litter.

### Plant Effects in Incubations

Presence of plants (across all treatments):
- **Decreased net nitrification** (P=0.005 for *Deschampsia* soil)
- **Decreased net ammonification** (P=0.014 for *Deschampsia* soil)
- Interpreted as **plant N uptake dominating** over potential priming effects
- No evidence of root exudation stimulating decomposition (unlike subarctic studies)

### Complex Interactions

**Non-additive effects were common**:
- Warming effects often **counteracted** when combined with CO2 and drought
- Significant two-way interactions:
  - T×CO2 for microbial N immobilization (*Deschampsia*, P=0.076)
  - D×CO2 for nitrification (*Deschampsia*, P=0.056), DON (*Calluna*, P=0.017)
  - D×T for DOC production (*Deschampsia*, P=0.076)
- Three-way interaction (D×T×CO2):
  - Nitrification in *Deschampsia* (P=0.076)
  - DON in *Calluna* (P=0.017)

**Example**: Microbial P immobilization in *Deschampsia* soil showed D×CO2 interaction (P=0.033) - drought reversed the negative CO2 effect.

### Species-Specific Soil Responses

**Deschampsia soil**:
- More responsive to treatments overall
- Strong drought suppression of N cycling
- Clear CO2 effects on P availability

**Calluna soil**:
- Less responsive to single factors
- Warming promoted plant growth and nutrient uptake
- Drought increased microbial C storage

## Major Findings

### 1. Drought Suppresses Nitrogen Cycling

Especially in *Deschampsia* soil:
- Reduced nitrification, DON production, litter decomposition
- Moisture limitation constrains microbial activity
- Plant N uptake correspondingly decreased

### 2. Warming Promotes Nutrient Mobilization

Particularly beneficial for *Calluna*:
- Increased decomposition rates
- Net release of N and P from microbial pools
- Plants responded with increased biomass and N/P uptake
- Suggests nutrient limitation was alleviated by warming

### 3. Elevated CO2 Constrains Phosphorus Availability

Novel finding:
- Decreased P mineralization and microbial P immobilization
- **First field evidence**: Citric acid concentration doubled under elevated CO2
- Mechanism likely: CO2-induced soil acidification → increased P occlusion on Fe/Al minerals
- Soil-specific effect (pH 4.6 sandy soil)

### 4. Interactions Trump Main Effects

- Combined treatments often produced unexpected results
- Single-factor studies insufficient for climate change predictions
- Emphasizes need for multi-factorial field experiments

## Implications for EcoSIM Modeling

### This Study Provides:

**High-quality validation data**:
- Precise quantification of climate manipulations
- Species-specific soil responses
- Microbial biomass stoichiometry (C:N:P ratios)
- Process rates (mineralization, nitrification, decomposition)
- Treatment response magnitudes and directions

**Process understanding**:
- Moisture limitation of decomposition
- Temperature sensitivity of microbial processes
- CO2 effects on soil chemistry and P cycling
- Plant-microbe competition for nutrients
- Species-specific rhizosphere effects

**Model testing opportunities**:
- Can EcoSIM reproduce species-specific responses?
- Does it capture drought suppression of N cycling?
- Can it simulate CO2-induced P limitation?
- Are interaction effects emergent or need explicit parameterization?

### Key Parameters for EcoSIM

1. **Initial conditions** (November 2006 ambient soil properties table)
2. **Climate forcing** (1.5°C warming, 510 ppm CO2, 5% vs 17% soil moisture)
3. **Plant functional types** (C3 grass, C3 evergreen shrub with documented traits)
4. **Validation targets**:
   - Nitrification rates: -0.3 to +0.3 μg N g⁻¹ SOM day⁻¹
   - Ammonification rates: -0.6 to +1.0 μg N g⁻¹ SOM day⁻¹
   - Microbial C:N ratio: 5.8-7.5
   - Microbial N:P ratio: 2.9-3.5
   - Litter k: 0.0011-0.0019 yr⁻¹

## Relevance to Warming/Nitrogen Meta-Analysis

**High relevance**:
- One of few multi-factorial experiments globally
- Directly addresses warming effects on N cycling
- Quantifies microbial vs. plant nutrient competition
- Documents drought interactions (important for future climate scenarios)
- Provides species-level resolution for competitive dynamics

**Limitations**:
- Short duration (18 months treatment)
- Single soil type (acidic sandy soil)
- Temperate zone only
- No direct N addition treatment (but relevant to understanding N availability under warming)

## Notes

- Study emphasizes **species-specific responses** - critical for heathland management
- **Citric acid finding** is novel and important for understanding CO2 effects on nutrient availability
- **Plant presence decreased soil N** pools but provided valuable context on net nutrient availability
- Authors note responses often **smaller than natural seasonal variation** - highlights challenge of detecting climate effects in temperate systems
- Comparison to **subarctic studies** shows ecosystem-specific responses (no priming effect observed here)
