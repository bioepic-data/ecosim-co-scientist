# Growth and community responses of alpine dwarf shrubs to in situ CO₂ enrichment and soil warming

## Study Citation and Significance

**Citation:** Dawes, M.A., Hagedorn, F., Zumbrunn, T., Handa, I.T., Hättenschwiler, S., Wipf, S., & Rixen, C. (2011). Growth and community responses of alpine dwarf shrubs to in situ CO₂ enrichment and soil warming. *New Phytologist*, 191, 806-818.

**Study Significance:**
This is a **landmark multifactor climate change experiment** combining 9 years of CO₂ enrichment with 3 years of soil warming at alpine treeline in the Swiss Alps. It is one of the **ONLY in situ studies combining elevated CO₂ and warming at high elevation**.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Longest-running alpine CO₂ enrichment experiment** - 9 years using FACE technology
2. **Species-specific responses** - *Vaccinium myrtillus* showed clear positive responses to both CO₂ and warming, while co-occurring dwarf shrubs did not
3. **NO interactive effects** - CO₂ and warming effects were INDEPENDENT, facilitating predictive modeling
4. **Community shifts** - Vascular plant richness declined under elevated CO₂ (with larch), nonvascular species declined with warming
5. **Sustained CO₂ response** - *V. myrtillus* growth stimulation showed NO DECLINE over 8 years, contrasting with many other studies
6. **Nitrogen dynamics** - Warming increased soil inorganic N (+140% by year 3) and leaf N concentration

**Context:** High-elevation ecosystems are expected to experience particularly large impacts from climate change due to low temperature limits and reduced atmospheric CO₂ partial pressure at altitude, yet long-term multifactor experiments in these environments are extremely rare.

## Experimental Design

### Overall Structure
- **Design:** Balanced factorial with tree species as split-plot factor
- **Total plots:** 40 hexagonal plots (1.1 m² each)
- **Replication:** 5 replicate blocks for each treatment combination
- **Duration:**
  - CO₂ enrichment: June 2001 - September 2009 (9 growing seasons)
  - Soil warming: May 2007 - September 2009 (3 growing seasons)

### Treatment Allocation

**CO₂ treatment groups:**
- 10 groups of 4 neighboring plots (2 larch + 2 pine per group)
- 5 groups assigned to elevated CO₂
- 5 groups served as ambient CO₂ controls
- Facilitated logistics of CO₂ distribution

**Warming treatment (nested within CO₂ groups):**
- Started in 2007 (7th year of CO₂ enrichment)
- 1 plot of each tree species per CO₂ group assigned warming
- Final design: 5 replicates per CO₂ × warming × tree species combination

### CO₂ Enrichment Method: Free Air CO₂ Enrichment (FACE)

**Target concentration:**
- **Elevated CO₂:** 575 ± 52 ppm (mean ± 1 SD) from 2001-2009
- **Ambient CO₂:** ~380 ppm

**Delivery system:**
- Pure CO₂ gas released through laser-punched drip irrigation tubes
- Tubes hung vertically around hexagonal frame surrounding each plot
- **Daytime only** release during growing season

**Treatment coverage:**
- 73-87% of seasonal daytime-only treatment periods received supplementary CO₂
- Interruptions due to adverse weather or technical failures

**Previous descriptions:**
- Hättenschwiler et al. (2002) - set-up and performance
- Handa et al. (2006) - system details
- Dawes et al. (2011) - tree responses

### Soil Warming Method: Heating Cables

**Method:**
- Heating cables laid on ground surface underneath dwarf shrub layer
- More feasible than OTCs or infrared radiators given tall trees and steep rocky terrain
- Less disturbance than chamber methods

**Timing:**
- Turned on immediately after snowmelt each spring
- Turned off just before site covered in snow for winter
- **Avoided interaction** between soil temperature and snow cover duration

**Temperature effects:**
- **2007:** +3.9 ± 0.3°C at 5 cm depth (mean ± 1 SE; n=10)
- **2008:** +4.4 ± 0.5°C at 5 cm depth
- **2009:** +3.1 ± 0.4°C at 5 cm depth
- **Air temperature:** Increased up to 20 cm above ground (+0.9 ± 0.1 K)
- **No temperature difference** at 50 cm height

**Moisture effects:**
- Slight drying effect, most pronounced in late summer
- Growing season mean:
  - Volumetric soil water content (0-10 cm): Reduced by ~15%
  - Air humidity (10 cm height): Reduced by ~10%
- **NO strong water stress:** Soil water potential always >-300 hPa (high water availability)
- Drying effects irrespective of CO₂ treatment and tree species

**Design rationale:**
- Method allowed greater soil warming than OTCs
- Avoided confounding with snow cover duration
- Feasible given site constraints (steep, rocky, tall trees)

### Plant Growth Measurements

**Annual shoot increment length (2002-2009):**
- **Sampling:** Autumn each year after shoot elongation complete
- **Protocol:**
  - Measured longest branch on 5-7 randomly selected ramets per plot
  - Shoots experience less self-shading, less likely reduced growth from light competition
  - Ramets within 10 cm of plot border excluded (avoid edge effects)
- **Measurement years:**
  - 2002: Half of plots measured (n=5 per CO₂ × tree species combination)
  - 2003-2009: All plots measured
- **Correlation with biomass:** Highly correlated with gross annual above-ground biomass production per ramet

**Understorey vegetation height (2008-2009):**
- Mean of three random point measurements per plot
- Late summer measurements
- Positively correlated with total above-ground biomass per unit area

**Maximum ramet height per species (2008-2009):**
- Measured for *V. myrtillus*, *V. gaultherioides*, *E. hermaphroditum*

- Recorded all vascular and nonvascular (moss, lichen) species present
- Peak of growing season surveys
- Documented changes in species richness and composition

### Leaf Morphology

**Sampling (early August 2006-2009):**
- **Species:** *V. myrtillus* and *V. gaultherioides* only
  - *E. hermaphroditum* leaves too small and folded for accurate individual measurement
- **Sample size:** ~50 leaves per plot
- **Distribution:** Collected from whole canopy, evenly across distinct ramets, avoiding plot edges

**Measurements:**
- **Leaf area:** Scanned within 12 hours, analyzed with ImageJ version 1.43k
  - Not available from 2008
- **Dry mass:** Dried at 60°C for ≥24 hours, weighed
- **Specific leaf area (SLA):** Calculated as area/mass (cm² g⁻¹)
- **Herbivory correction:** Missing leaf parts filled (<4% of potential area per leaf)

### Nitrogen Measurements

**Soil inorganic N pool size:**
- **Timing:** August 2004, 2007, 2009
- **Depth:** 0-5 cm
- **Protocol:**

- **Purpose:** Estimate plant N status

### Environmental Measurements

**Canopy shading (2008):**
- **Method:** Hemispherical photographs
- **Timing:** Seasonal peak of leaf area
- **Definition:** Percentage of sky obstructed by:
  - Tree trunk and canopy
  - Trees in surrounding area
  - Topographic elements
- **Result:** Slightly greater for larch than pine plots on average
- **CO₂ effect:** Larch growth stimulation → greater canopy cover in elevated CO₂ + larch plots

**Soil volumetric water content (2007-2009):**
- Calculated seasonal mean per plot
- Depth: 0-10 cm
- Quantified inter-plot variation and warming-induced drying

**Snowmelt date and topography:**
- Estimated for each plot
- Did NOT vary significantly between treatment groups

### Statistical Analyses

**CO₂ enrichment effects (2002-2009, pooling warmed and unwarmed):**
- **Model:** Repeated measures linear mixed effects (REML)
- **Between-subject factors:** CO₂ concentration, tree species, interaction
- **Within-subject factors:** Year (categorical), all 2- and 3-way interactions with year
- **Rationale for pooling:** Likelihood ratio tests showed NO significant CO₂ × warming interactions

**Soil warming effects (2007-2009):**

- **Covariables:** Pre-treatment values included:
  - Shoot growth: 2005-2006 average
  - Leaf morphology and N: 2006 values
  - Soil inorganic N: 2004 values

**Species richness (2009):**
- **Model:** Single model testing both CO₂ and warming effects
- **Covariable:** 2005 richness values

**Random effects:**
- Specific intercepts for CO₂ treatment groups (10) and warming groups (20) excluded (very small, nonsignificant)
- Only random effects for individual plots retained

**Error distributions:**
- Normal distribution for most parameters
- Poisson distribution for nonvascular species richness (better fit)

**Transformations:**
- Log-transformed in some cases to improve normality and homoscedasticity

**Regression analyses:**
- **Environmental influences:** Canopy shading (2008), soil moisture (2007-2009) tested as predictors
- **Species richness drivers:** Understorey height, individual species ramet height (2008-2009 average)
- **N availability-growth relationships:** Shoot increment vs soil inorganic N and leaf N (standardized to pre-warming)

**Significance thresholds:**
- P < 0.05: Significant
- 0.05 ≤ P < 0.10: Marginally significant
- Low replication (n=5) limited statistical power

**Software:**
- R version 2.11.1
- NLME package for mixed models

## Major Findings Summary

### SPECIES-SPECIFIC RESPONSES: Vaccinium myrtillus Dominance

**Key pattern:** Of three co-occurring ericaceous dwarf shrub species, **ONLY *Vaccinium myrtillus* showed clear positive responses** to both CO₂ enrichment and soil warming.

### 1. CO₂ Enrichment Effects (9 Years)

**Vaccinium myrtillus - SUSTAINED POSITIVE RESPONSE:**
- **Annual shoot growth:** +12% stimulation averaged across 8 years (F₁,₃₆=7.9, P<0.01)
- **NO DECLINE over time:** P>0.9 for CO₂ × year interaction
- **Total ramet height:** Significantly enhanced (P≤0.01)
- **Understorey vegetation height:** Positively enhanced (P≤0.01)
- **Leaf area:** Marginally significant increase (P=0.06)
  - May be partially driven by increased shading in elevated CO₂ plots
- **Leaf mass:** Marginally significant increase (P=0.06)
- **SLA:** No significant change (P>0.19)

**Vaccinium gaultherioides - TREE SPECIES-DEPENDENT:**
- **Shoot growth:** Significant CO₂ × tree species interaction (F₁,₃₆=5.9, P=0.02)
  - Slight negative response in plots with larch
  - Slight positive response in plots with pine
- **Total ramet height:** Marginally significant CO₂ × tree species interaction (F₁,₃₆=4.1, P=0.05)
  - Positive response with pine
  - Slight negative response with larch
- **Mechanism unclear:** NOT explained by light, snowmelt, topography, soil moisture, leaf N, or soil N

**Empetrum hermaphroditum - NO RESPONSE:**
- **Shoot growth:** No effect of CO₂ or tree species (P>0.16)
- **Total ramet height:** No effect of CO₂ (P>0.05)
- **Tree species effect:** Lower ramet height in larch plots than pine (F₁,₃₂=5.4, P=0.03)
  - May be explained by canopy shading (P=0.09 relationship)

**Interpretation - Why V. myrtillus responded:**
- **Higher SLA:** 20-30% higher than *V. gaultherioides*, >50% higher than *E. hermaphroditum*
  - More leaf area per unit mass invested
  - Efficient light capture and high photosynthetic capacity
  - Larger assimilation gains under elevated CO₂
- **Lower elevational distribution:** <3000 m vs >3000 m for other two species
  - May be better adapted to warmer conditions

### 2. Soil Warming Effects (3 Years)

**Vaccinium myrtillus - STRONG POSITIVE RESPONSE:**
- **Annual shoot growth:** +31% relative to pre-warming years (F₁,₃₅=12.4, P<0.01)
  - **More than double the CO₂ effect**
- **Consistency:** Response sustained across all 3 years
- **Pre-treatment correlation:** 2005-2006 growth predicted warming-period growth (P<0.04)
- **No tree species or year interactions**

**Vaccinium gaultherioides - NO RESPONSE:**
- **Shoot growth:** No significant warming effect
- Pre-treatment growth influenced warming-period growth (P<0.04)

**Empetrum hermaphroditum - NO SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE:**
- **Shoot growth:** No significant effect
- **Trend:** Slight stimulation in 2009 only
- Pre-treatment growth influenced warming-period growth (P<0.04)

**Why warming > CO₂ for V. myrtillus:**
- Direct temperature stimulation of photosynthesis
- Enhanced nutrient availability (see nitrogen section below)
- Possibly better temperature adaptation

### 3. NO Interactive Effects: Independent Responses

**Critical finding:** Likelihood ratio tests indicated **NONE of the interactions between CO₂ and warming contributed significantly** to model fits for any measured parameter.

**Implications:**
- CO₂ and warming act INDEPENDENTLY on plant growth
- Responses to CO₂ NOT constrained by low temperature or low N availability
- Warming did NOT alleviate temperature/nutrient constraints on CO₂ response
- **Facilitates predictive modeling:** Additive rather than synergistic effects

**Contrast with hypotheses:**
- Hypothesis: Warming would alleviate constraints on CO₂ response → **REJECTED**
- Hypothesis: Positive CO₂ × warming interaction → **REJECTED**

**Comparison to other studies:**
- Glasshouse tussock tundra (Oechel et al. 1994): Positive CO₂ × warming interaction
- Most grassland field studies: Conflicting results on interactions
- Alpine grassland (Körner et al. 1997): No CO₂ response even with NPK fertilization

### 4. Nitrogen Dynamics

**Soil inorganic N - STRONG WARMING RESPONSE:**
- **Overall effect:** F₁,₃₅=9.5, P<0.01
- **2007:** +52% in warmed vs unwarmed (standardized to 2004)
- **2009:** +140% in warmed vs unwarmed
- **Mechanism:** Warming accelerated N mineralization

**Soil solution:**
- NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ always below detection limit (0.1 mg N l⁻¹)
- K₂SO₄-extractable NO₃⁻ not detectable
- **NO net nitrification**

**CO₂ effects on N pools:**
- Soil inorganic N: No significant effect (P>0.19)
- Leaf N concentration: Trend toward lower values under elevated CO₂
  - Marginally significant CO₂ × tree species × year interaction for *V. myrtillus*
  - Not statistically significant overall

**Leaf N concentration - WARMING RESPONSE:**
- **Both Vaccinium species:** Positive influence of warming
- **V. myrtillus:** Marginally significant warming × year interaction (F₁,₃₅=2.8, P=0.07)
  - Effect declined over 3 years (largest in 2007, smallest in 2009)
- **Interpretation:** Greater growth stimulation in 2008-2009 diluted N uptake increase
  - Larger total N pool in biomass, but no concentration increase

**Leaf N patterns:**
- **Generally higher** in *V. gaultherioides* than *V. myrtillus*
- **Increased** with canopy shading for both species
- **Tended to be lower** in plots with pine than larch

**Growth-N relationships (V. myrtillus only):**
- **Weak positive correlation:** Shoot increment vs leaf N (P<0.05 in 2007, 2009)
- **Weak positive correlation:** Shoot increment vs soil N in 2009 (P=0.03), not 2007
- **NO relationships** for *V. gaultherioides* or *E. hermaphroditum*

**Interpretation:**
- Increased N availability **partially responsible** for *V. myrtillus* warming response
- **Other mechanisms also important:** Direct temperature effects on photosynthesis
- CO₂ growth response NOT N-limited

### 5. Community Composition Changes

**Vascular plant species richness:**
- **CO₂ × tree species interaction:** F₁,₃₁=4.6, P=0.04 (after accounting for 2005 values)
- **Larch plots:** Marginally significant negative CO₂ effect (F₁,₁₅=3.9, P=0.07)
  - Mean loss: 1.3 ± 0.6 species over 4 years in elevated CO₂
  - No change in ambient CO₂ plots
- **Pine plots:** Opposite but nonsignificant pattern (F₁,₁₅=1.1, P=0.30)
  - Somewhat more species losses in ambient CO₂ plots
- **Warming:** No significant effect

**Nonvascular species (mosses and lichens) richness:**
- **Overall decline** from 2005 to 2009
- **Warming effect:** Significantly negative (P=0.02)
  - More species lost from warmed plots
  - Especially warmed + elevated CO₂ plots
- **Soil moisture correlation:** Lower moisture associated with more nonvascular losses (P=0.07)
- **Interpretation:** Drying associated with warming partly responsible

**Drivers of richness changes:**
- **Vascular richness:** Lower in plots with taller *V. myrtillus* ramets (P<0.07)
- **No influence of:** Canopy shading, overall understorey height, soil moisture (vascular species)
- **Mechanism:** Increased shading within understorey canopy and/or below-ground competition from dominant *V. myrtillus*

**Species lost most frequently:**
- See Table S9 in original paper for detailed list

**Overall interpretation:**
- Enhanced *V. myrtillus* dominance → competitive exclusion of other species
- Warming-induced drying → loss of moisture-dependent mosses and lichens
- **Less diverse plant communities** likely outcome of ongoing environmental change at alpine treeline

**Körner et al. (1997) - Alpine grassland, Swiss Central Alps:**
- Late successional alpine grassland
- **Result:** Small or nonexistent biomass responses to elevated CO₂

**Walker et al. (2006) - Arctic warming meta-analysis:**
- Increased vascular plant productivity associated with reduced moss/lichen abundance
- **Attributed to increased shading** - consistent with current study
- But current study: **Drying also important** (correlation with soil moisture)

### Combined CO₂ + Warming Studies

**Oechel et al. (1994) - Alaska tussock tundra glasshouse:**
- CO₂ stimulation of NPP lasted only 1 season when applied alone
- **Sustained over 3 growing seasons** when combined with +4°C and unaltered water

**Alpine + fertilization (not warming):**
- Körner et al. (1997): CO₂ + NPK → No positive effect
- N. Inauen (pers. comm.): FACE + N addition on glacier forefield → No CO₂ effect or interaction

**Current study's contribution:**
- **First in situ high-elevation CO₂ + warming study**
- **Clear result: NO interactions** - independent effects
- **Facilitates modeling:** Additive rather than synergistic

## Mechanisms and Processes

### Why Vaccinium myrtillus Responds to CO₂

**1. Leaf trait advantages:**
- **Higher SLA** than co-occurring species:
  - 20-30% higher than *V. gaultherioides*
  - >50% higher than *E. hermaphroditum*
- **More leaf area per unit mass** → Efficient light capture
- **High photosynthetic capacity** per unit investment
- **Larger assimilation gains** under elevated CO₂

**2. Sustained response mechanism:**
- **NO temporal decline** over 8 years of CO₂ enrichment
- **NOT N-limited:** Soil N pools and leaf N did not decline under elevated CO₂
- **Enhanced growth did NOT lead to progressive N limitation** - contrast with many studies

**3. Species ecology:**
- **Lower elevational distribution:** <3000 m vs >3000 m for other two species
- **Potentially better adapted** to conditions at this elevation
- **May be intrinsically more responsive** to CO₂

### Why Vaccinium myrtillus Responds to Warming

**1. Direct temperature effects:**
- **Photosynthesis stimulation** at higher temperatures
- **Deciduous leaf habit** - may respond better than evergreen *E. hermaphroditum*
- But *V. gaultherioides* also deciduous and did NOT respond → leaf type not sole factor

**2. Nitrogen availability enhancement:**
- **Soil inorganic N increased** strongly with warming (+52% to +140%)
- **Leaf N concentration increased** in first year of warming
- **Growth-N correlations weak but positive** for *V. myrtillus* only
- **Partial contribution** to growth response

**3. Species adaptation:**
- **Lower elevational distribution** → potentially better adapted to warmer temperatures
- **Intrinsically more responsive** to temperature increase

**4. Why warming > CO₂ effect:**
- **31% growth stimulation** from warming vs **12% from CO₂**
- **Combination of direct temperature + N availability** effects
- **More pronounced on physiology** than CO₂

### Why Other Species Did NOT Respond

**Vaccinium gaultherioides:**
- **Lower SLA** than *V. myrtillus*
- **Higher elevational distribution** → may be adapted to cooler conditions
- **Tree species-dependent CO₂ response** - mechanism unclear
  - NOT explained by light, N, moisture, or other measured variables
  - May relate to litter quality, belowground competition, or unmeasured nutrients

**Empetrum hermaphroditum:**
- **Lowest SLA** of three species
- **Evergreen** vs deciduous
- **Higher elevational distribution**
- **Smaller leaves** - different growth strategy
- **Taller under pine than larch** - negative relationship with canopy shading

### Independent CO₂ and Warming Effects

**Why NO interactions:**

1. **CO₂ response NOT N-limited:**
   - Soil N pools did not decline under elevated CO₂
   - Leaf N concentrations not significantly affected
   - Growth sustained over 8 years without progressive N limitation

2. **CO₂ response NOT temperature-limited:**
   - *V. myrtillus* already responsive to CO₂ at ambient temperature
   - Warming did NOT enhance CO₂ responsiveness

3. **Warming response NOT CO₂-limited:**
   - Enhanced N availability and direct temperature effects sufficient
   - Elevated CO₂ did NOT enhance warming responsiveness

4. **Different physiological mechanisms:**
   - CO₂: Direct photosynthetic stimulation via Rubisco carboxylation
   - Warming: Temperature-enhanced metabolism + N availability
   - **Operate on different pathways** → additive effects

**Implications for prediction:**
- **Simpler models possible:** Independent rather than interactive terms
- **Additive effects** easier to parameterize than synergistic
- **Linear responses** to combined drivers

### Community Composition Changes

**Mechanisms of species loss:**

**1. Vaccinium myrtillus competitive dominance:**
- **Enhanced growth** → increased above-ground biomass
- **Taller ramets** → increased shading within understorey
- **Below-ground competition** likely increased
- **Vascular species richness correlated** with *V. myrtillus* height (P<0.07)
- **Competitive exclusion** of less responsive species

**2. Larch-specific CO₂ effects:**
- **Larch growth stimulated** by elevated CO₂ (Dawes et al. 2011)
- **Greater canopy cover** in elevated CO₂ + larch plots
- **More shading** → species loss
- **BUT:** Canopy shading NOT significantly related to vascular richness
- **Within-understorey processes more important** than tree canopy effects

**3. Warming-induced drying:**
- **Volumetric soil moisture** reduced ~15% (0-10 cm)
- **Air humidity** reduced ~10% (10 cm height)
- **Nonvascular species particularly sensitive** to moisture
- **Correlation:** Lower soil moisture → more moss/lichen losses (P=0.07)
- **Direct drying effect** on moisture-dependent species

**4. Combined elevated CO₂ + warming:**
- **Greatest moss/lichen losses** in combined treatment
- **Additive stresses:** Increased vascular competition + drying

### Nitrogen Cycling Dynamics

**Warming acceleration of N mineralization:**
- **Year 1 (2007):** +52% soil inorganic N
- **Year 3 (2009):** +140% soil inorganic N
- **Progressive enhancement** over time

**Why N response sustained:**
- **High water availability:** Soil water potential always >-300 hPa
- **Not water-limited** decomposition
- **Temperature-sensitive process** continuously stimulated
- **Contrast with some studies:** Hartley et al. (1999) found no effect by year 5

**Leaf N dilution in later years:**
- **Year 1 warming:** Strong leaf N concentration increase
- **Years 2-3:** Effect declined
- **Mechanism:** Greater growth stimulation diluted N uptake increase
  - Total N in biomass increased
  - But concentration did not change (same ratio)

**CO₂ effects on N:**
- **NO significant change** in soil inorganic N pools
- **Trend toward lower** leaf N concentration (not significant)
- **Growth response sustained** despite possible slight N dilution
- **NOT progressively N-limited** - contrast with many CO₂ studies

## EcoSIM Modeling Relevance

### Critical Insights for Model Development

**1. Species-Specific Responses Essential**

**Challenge:** Models often treat plant functional types uniformly

**Reality from this study:**
- Three co-occurring ericaceous dwarf shrubs showed COMPLETELY DIFFERENT responses
- *V. myrtillus*: Strong positive responses to both CO₂ and warming
- *V. gaultherioides*: Complex tree species-dependent CO₂ response, no warming response
- *E. hermaphroditum*: No clear responses to either treatment

**EcoSIM implications:**
- **Cannot group by functional type** (all are ericaceous deciduous/evergreen dwarf shrubs)
- **Species-level parameterization** needed for accurate predictions
- **Trait-based approaches** may help: SLA, leaf type, elevational distribution

**2. Independent CO₂ and Warming Effects**

**Major finding:** NO significant interactions between treatments for ANY measured parameter

**Model simplification:**
- **Additive rather than multiplicative** effects on growth
- **Separate parameterization** of CO₂ and warming responses
- **Linear combination** of effects rather than complex interactions

**Mechanistic basis:**
- CO₂: Direct photosynthetic stimulation
- Warming: Temperature effects on metabolism + N availability enhancement
- **Operate through different pathways** → independent

**EcoSIM implementation:**
```
Growth_response = Baseline + CO2_effect + Warming_effect
NOT: Growth_response = Baseline * (1 + CO2_effect) * (1 + Warming_effect)
```

**3. Sustained CO₂ Response Without Progressive N Limitation**

**Key observation:** *V. myrtillus* CO₂ response sustained over 8 years with NO decline

**Contrast with common pattern:**
- Many studies show initial CO₂ stimulation declining over time
- Often attributed to progressive N limitation (Luo et al. 2004)

**Why sustained in this study:**
- Soil inorganic N did NOT decline under elevated CO₂
- Leaf N concentration showed only slight non-significant trend downward
- Growth enhancement did NOT deplete available N pools

**Model requirements:**
- **DO NOT assume automatic progressive N limitation** under elevated CO₂
- **Depends on ecosystem N availability and cycling rates**
- **Alpine systems may have sufficient N** cycling to sustain CO₂ response
- **Need to model N mineralization accurately** to predict when limitation occurs

**4. Warming-Enhanced N Availability**

**Empirical pattern:**
- +3-4°C warming → +52% to +140% soil inorganic N over 3 years
- **Progressive enhancement** over time
- Sustained even in year 3

**Mechanism:**
- Temperature-accelerated N mineralization
- Not water-limited (soil water potential >-300 hPa)

**Model parameterization:**
- Q₁₀ for N mineralization in alpine soils
- Temperature-moisture interactions on decomposition
- Sufficient water availability maintains response

**Coupling to plant growth:**
- Weak but positive correlations for *V. myrtillus* only
- **Partial contribution** to growth response
- **Direct temperature effects also important**

**Model needs:**
- Represent both direct temperature effects on plant physiology AND indirect effects through N availability
- Species-specific N use efficiency and responsiveness

**5. Leaf Trait Mechanisms**

**SLA as predictor:**
- **Higher SLA** in *V. myrtillus* associated with stronger CO₂ response
- **Mechanism:** More leaf area per unit mass → efficient light capture → larger CO₂ gains

**Model implementation:**
- **SLA as functional trait** predicting CO₂ responsiveness
- **Photosynthetic capacity** scaled by SLA
- **Carbon gain efficiency** under elevated CO₂ proportional to SLA

**Other traits:**
- Leaf type (deciduous vs evergreen)
- Elevational distribution (adaptation to temperature)
- Species identity (intrinsic responsiveness)

**Trait-based modeling approach:**
- **Generalize beyond specific species** using trait values
- **Predict responses for unstudied species** based on trait matching
- **Validate with species-specific studies** like this one

**6. Community Dynamics and Competitive Interactions**

**Empirical pattern:**
- Enhanced *V. myrtillus* growth → reduced species richness
- Taller *V. myrtillus* ramets → fewer vascular species
- Warming-induced drying → moss/lichen losses

**Model requirements:**
- **Competition for light** within understorey (not just tree canopy)
- **Below-ground competition** for nutrients and water
- **Height-based shading** algorithms
- **Moisture thresholds** for nonvascular species

**Community assembly rules:**
- **Responsive species increase dominance** under global change
- **Less responsive species competitively excluded**
- **Moisture-dependent species sensitive to warming-induced drying**

**EcoSIM implementation:**
- Individual-based or cohort-based models to track species composition
- Competition coefficients based on relative growth rates under treatments
- Moisture thresholds for moss/lichen presence

**7. Tree Species Effects on Understorey**

**Empirical patterns:**
- *V. gaultherioides* CO₂ response depended on tree species
- *V. gaultherioides* and *E. hermaphroditum* ramet height lower under larch than pine
- Elevated CO₂ stimulated larch growth → greater canopy cover

**Model complications:**
- **Tree-understorey interactions** modify treatment responses
- **Canopy shading** affects understorey directly
- **Litter quality** may differ between tree species
- **Below-ground interactions** (roots, mycorrhizae)

**Model needs:**
- Represent multiple vegetation layers
- Tree growth responses to treatments
- Cascading effects of tree responses on understorey
- Light transmission through canopy

**8. High-Elevation Specific Parameterization**

**Alpine ecosystem characteristics:**
- **Low atmospheric pressure** → lower CO₂ partial pressure
- **Potential for larger CO₂ responses** than lowlands
- **Low temperature constraints** on growth
- **High solar radiation** during growing season
- **Short growing season**
- **Snow cover dynamics** critical

**Current study contributions:**
- **In situ responses at 2180 m** elevation
- **Treeline ecosystem** - transition zone
- **Long-term data** (9 years CO₂, 3 years warming)

**Model calibration:**
- **Altitude-specific parameterization** needed
- **Growing season length** and temperature constraints
- **Snow cover interactions** with warming (avoided in this study by timing)

## Conclusions and Broader Implications

### Key Conclusions

1. **Species-specific responses are the rule, not the exception:** Three co-occurring ericaceous dwarf shrubs showed completely different responses to 9 years of CO₂ enrichment and 3 years of soil warming.

2. **Vaccinium myrtillus is uniquely responsive:** This species showed sustained positive growth responses to both elevated CO₂ (+12% over 8 years) and soil warming (+31% over 3 years), while *V. gaultherioides* and *E. hermaphroditum* showed no clear positive responses.

3. **NO interactive effects between CO₂ and warming:** Responses were independent and additive, simplifying predictive modeling approaches.

4. **Sustained CO₂ response without progressive N limitation:** *V. myrtillus* CO₂ stimulation showed no decline over 8 years, with no decrease in soil inorganic N pools or leaf N concentrations.

5. **Warming enhanced N availability:** Soil inorganic N increased 52-140% over 3 years with +3-4°C warming, partially contributing to growth responses.

6. **Community composition changes:** Vascular plant species richness declined in elevated CO₂ plots (with larch), and moss/lichen species declined with warming, likely due to increased *V. myrtillus* dominance and warming-induced drying.

7. **Higher SLA predicts CO₂ responsiveness:** *V. myrtillus* has 20-50% higher SLA than co-occurring species, potentially explaining its greater assimilation gains under elevated CO₂.

### Broader Implications

**For Alpine Ecosystems:**

1. **Increased dominance of responsive species:**
   - Ongoing environmental change likely to favor *V. myrtillus* over other dwarf shrubs
   - Less diverse plant communities at alpine treeline
   - Shifts in ecosystem function and C/N cycling

2. **Treeline dynamics:**
   - Enhanced tree growth under elevated CO₂ (larch; Dawes et al. 2011)
   - Altered tree-understorey interactions
   - Potential treeline advance with cascading effects

3. **Nonvascular species at risk:**
   - Warming-induced drying threatens moss and lichen diversity
   - Loss of important ecosystem components
   - Altered hydrology and nutrient cycling

**For Climate Change Predictions:**

1. **Independent treatment effects facilitate modeling:**
   - Additive responses easier to parameterize than synergistic
   - Separate CO₂ and warming modules in models
   - Linear rather than multiplicative predictions

2. **Trait-based approaches promising:**
   - SLA as predictor of CO₂ responsiveness
   - Leaf type (deciduous vs evergreen) relevant
   - Elevational distribution indicates temperature adaptation

3. **Progressive N limitation NOT universal:**
   - Sustained CO₂ responses possible with sufficient N cycling
   - Ecosystem-specific parameterization needed
   - Cannot assume automatic long-term response decline

4. **Species-level resolution essential:**
   - Functional type approaches insufficient
   - Co-occurring species within same family show opposite responses
   - Community dynamics require species-specific models

**For Experimental Design:**

1. **Long-term experiments critical:**
   - 9 years revealed sustained rather than declining CO₂ response
   - Temporal dynamics differ from short-term studies
   - Need decade-plus experiments for full understanding

2. **Multifactor experiments valuable:**
   - Revealed independent effects (important negative result)
   - Tested realistic future scenarios
   - Rare at high elevation - need more

3. **Species-specific measurements necessary:**
   - Community-level responses miss critical patterns
   - Individual species drive ecosystem changes
   - Dominant species disproportionately important

**For Global Change Ecology:**

1. **High-elevation ecosystems particularly responsive:**
   - Low baseline temperatures → large proportional warming
   - Low CO₂ partial pressure → potentially large CO₂ effects
   - Short growing seasons → amplified per-day responses

2. **Competitive interactions modulate responses:**
   - Direct treatment effects compound with indirect competition effects
   - Enhanced growth of responsive species → exclusion of others
   - Community assembly rules shift under global change

3. **Moisture interactions critical:**
   - Warming-induced drying limits some responses
   - Moisture-dependent species (mosses, lichens) particularly vulnerable
   - Hydrology should be integrated with C and N cycling models

### Final Perspective

This landmark study provides **critical empirical data for parameterizing and testing alpine ecosystem responses to combined CO₂ enrichment and warming**. The finding of **independent, additive effects** is particularly valuable for modeling, as it simplifies predictive frameworks.

The **sustained, species-specific positive response of *Vaccinium myrtillus*** to both treatments over multiple years suggests that ongoing environmental change will lead to **less diverse, *V. myrtillus*-dominated communities** at alpine treeline. This has important implications for ecosystem function, as shifts in dominant species alter C and N cycling, vegetation structure, and wildlife habitat.

For **EcoSIM modeling**, this study highlights the absolute necessity of **species-level parameterization** and the importance of **trait-based approaches** (especially SLA) for predicting responses. The **independent CO₂ and warming effects** facilitate model development, allowing separate modules that can be linearly combined rather than requiring complex interaction terms.

The study's **9-year duration and multifactor design** at high elevation make it a uniquely valuable addition to the global change literature and an essential calibration/validation dataset for models projecting alpine ecosystem futures.
