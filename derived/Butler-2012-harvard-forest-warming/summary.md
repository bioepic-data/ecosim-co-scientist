- Treated as spatially replicated samples within treatment areas

**Pre-treatment similarity** (2002):
- Tree biomass: 202 vs 192 Mt ha⁻¹ (similar)
- Woody increment: 1.73 vs 1.69 Mt C ha⁻¹ (similar)
- N mineralization: Similar rates in both areas

**Statistical approach**:
- Non-parametric tests (Friedman's test for repeated measures)
- Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for independent samples
- Conservative given pseudoreplication

## Key Results

### Net N Mineralization and Nitrification

**Overall pattern**:
- **Significant warming increase**: P < 0.01 (Friedman's test)
- **Average increase**: +45% over 7 years in heated area relative to control
- **Mean annual increase**: +27.4 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (organic + mineral soil, 0-10 cm)
- **Persistence**: Remained elevated for full 7 years (no acclimation)

**Nitrification increase**:
- **Progressive increase** over 7-year period
- **By year 5**: 3× increase in NO₃⁻ production in heated area
- **By years 5-7**: 25% of NH₄⁺ produced during mineralization → NO₃⁻
- **Shift in N form**: From NH₄⁺-dominated to significant NO₃⁻ component

**Seasonal patterns** (averaged over years):

*Summer (June-August)*:
- Net mineralization: 45% of annual total (control), 37% (heated)
- Net nitrification: 55% of annual total (control), 49% (heated)
- Peak season for both processes

*Spring (April-May)*:
- Net mineralization: 21% of annual total (control), 23% (heated)
- Net nitrification: 25% of annual total (control), 32% (heated)

*Autumn (September-October)*:
- Net mineralization: 30% of annual total (control), 31% (heated)
- Net nitrification: 18% of annual total (control), 11% (heated)

*Winter (November-March)*:
- Net mineralization: 4% of annual total (control), 9% (heated)
- Net nitrification: 3% of annual total (control), 8% (heated)

**Warming effect on seasonality**:
- Summer proportion DECREASED for mineralization with warming
- Winter proportion INCREASED for both mineralization and nitrification with warming
- Spring and winter nitrification INCREASED with warming
- Fall and summer nitrification DECREASED with warming

### Nitrogen Losses

**Soil solution N** (lysimeters at 50 cm):
- Occasional spikes in NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ in both heated and control
- **No significant effect of warming** on solution losses through time
- System maintained closed N cycle

**Gaseous N₂O fluxes**:
- Both heated and control near detection limits
- **No discernible pattern** over years of warming
- No significant warming effect

**Interpretation**: Despite increased mineralization and nitrification, no N losses detected (closed cycle maintained)

### Foliar N

**Overall pattern**:
- **Significantly higher** in heated area since Year 2
- **P < 0.05 for each year** (Years 2-7)

**Species responses** (all dominant species showed higher %N with warming in most years):

*Red maple (Acer rubrum)*:
- **Largest and most consistent** response
- Year 6: **25% increase** in leaf N relative to control
- Greatest response of all canopy dominants

*Red oak (Quercus rubra)*:
- Higher %N with warming in most years
- Less consistent than red maple

*White ash (Fraxinus americana)*:
- Higher %N with warming in most years
- Less consistent than red maple

### N Resorption

**Stand-level**: No significant overall response to warming

**Species-level differences** (significant):

*Red maple*:
- **Highest leaf N resorption** compared to red oak and white ash in warmed area (P < 0.01 for each year)
- **Increased resorption efficiency** relative to control by Year 3 (P < 0.05 for each year)
- Efficient N conservation strategy

*Red oak*:
- By Year 6: **Significant decrease** in N resorption with warming (P = 0.04)
- Reduced N conservation

*White ash*:
- Variable response
- Year 2: Positive response to warming (P = 0.05)
- Year 3: Negative response to warming (P = 0.01)
- No consistent pattern

### Nitrate Reductase Activity (NRA)

**Year 2009 measurement** (corrected for canopy mass, μmoles NO₂⁻ m⁻² litter mass h⁻¹):

*Red oak*:
- Control: 2,524.1 ± 303.8
- Heated: 2,027.4 ± 271.4
- **Highest NRA** of all species in both areas
- No significant warming effect (P = 0.23)
- High capacity to utilize NO₃⁻

*White ash*:
- Control: 96.7 ± 22.7
- Heated: 35.0 ± 7.8
- **Significant warming effect** (P = 0.042)
- Intermediate NRA

*Red maple*:
- Control: 95.7 ± 107
- Heated: 10.3 ± 25.8
- Lowest NRA
- No significant warming effect (P = 0.77)
- Limited NO₃⁻ utilization capacity

**Interpretation**: Red oak has highest capacity to use NO₃⁻, but hasn't translated to growth advantage (yet)

### Tree Growth and Carbon Storage

**Overall C storage**: Increased with warming (Melillo et al. 2011)

**Relative growth rate** (all trees, corrected for pre-treatment differences):
- **Significant increase** with warming through time (P = 0.007)

**Species-specific responses**:

*Red maple (Acer rubrum)*:
- **Largest and most consistent** response
- **Doubled relative growth rate** in warmed areas (P = 0.01)
- Strongest growth response of all species

*Red oak (Quercus rubra)*:
- Greatest increase in absolute biomass
- Trends toward increased relative growth rate
- **Not significant** (P = 0.20)
- Despite high NRA, growth not yet enhanced

*White ash (Fraxinus americana)*:
- **No consistent pattern** of increased RGR with warming (P = 0.47)
- Variable year-to-year

**Litterfall** (proxy for canopy mass):
- **Overall increase** with warming: +60 kg C ha⁻¹

*Oak species (red and black oaks)*:
- Greatest increase by Year 5 (P = 0.006)
- Average annual increase: +35% relative to control over 7 years
- Strong canopy mass response

*Other dominant species*:
- More variation through time
- No clear pattern

## Major Findings

### 1. Sustained Increase in Net N Mineralization (+45% over 7 years)

**Magnitude**: +27.4 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ average increase

**Persistence**: Remained elevated for full 7 years (no acclimation or decline)

**Consistency**: Significant increase every year

**Comparison to other forest studies**:
- Consistent with Peterjohn et al. 1994, Hartley et al. 1999, Rustad et al. 2001, Melillo et al. 2002
- Some studies show declining response over time (this did not)

**Mechanism** (inferred, not directly measured):
- Enhanced microbial activity with warming
- Faster decomposition of soil organic matter
- Increased transformation of organic N → NH₄⁺

### 2. Three-Fold Increase in Nitrification (Progressive Over Time)

**Timeline**:
- Years 1-4: Modest increases
- **Year 5 onward**: 3× increase in NO₃⁻ production
- **Years 5-7**: 25% of mineralized N → NO₃⁻

**Shift in N economy**:
- Pre-treatment: Strongly NH₄⁺-dominated
- Year 7: Significant NO₃⁻ component (25%)
- Represents major change in N availability form

**Mechanisms** (proposed, not directly tested):

*Decreased microbial N immobilization*:
- Warming decreased labile soil organic matter (Bradford et al. 2008; Frey et al. 2008)
- Warming decreased microbial biomass (Bradford et al. 2008; Frey et al. 2008)
- Decreased microbial biomass → decreased immobilization
- More NH₄⁺ available to nitrifying bacteria
- Increased nitrification

*Enhanced nitrifier activity*:
- Higher temperatures directly stimulate nitrifying bacteria
- Q₁₀ effect on enzymatic rates

### 3. Maintained Closed N Cycle (No N Losses Despite Increased Availability)

**Evidence**:
- No significant warming effect on soil solution N (lysimeters at 50 cm)
- No significant warming effect on N₂O emissions
- Both remained near background/detection limits

**Interpretation**:
- Additional mineralized N retained in ecosystem
- Available for plant and microbial uptake
- No N saturation (yet) despite 7 years of elevated N cycling
- Plants and microbes capturing increased N

**Contrast with some warming studies**:
- Some show gaseous or solution N losses with warming
- This system still N-limited (increased N taken up, not lost)

### 4. Increased Foliar N in All Species (Since Year 2)

**Timeline**: Significant by Year 2, sustained through Year 7

**Magnitude**: Variable by species, up to 25% increase (red maple, Year 6)

**Implication**: Increased N availability → increased plant N acquisition

**Photosynthesis link**:
- Leaf N positively correlated with photosynthetic rate (Field and Mooney 1986; Reich et al. 1994, 1995, 1997; Ollinger et al. 2008)
- Global relationship observed across ecosystems
- Suggests increased C assimilation in heated area

### 5. Species-Specific Growth Responses (Red Maple Strongest)

**Red maple (*Acer rubrum*) - "Winner"**:
- Largest and most consistent foliar N increase (25% by Year 6)
- Highest N resorption efficiency (increased with warming)
- **Doubled relative growth rate** (P = 0.01)
- Strategy: Take up and store more N, increase growth
- Competitive advantage in warmer world with more N

**Red oak (*Quercus rubra*) - "Potential Winner"**:
- Highest nitrate reductase activity (both control and heated)
- Greatest absolute biomass increase
- Greatest litterfall increase (+35% over 7 years)
- BUT: Not yet significant RGR increase (P = 0.20)
- Strategy: High capacity to use NO₃⁻
- May have competitive advantage as NO₃⁻ fraction increases

**White ash (*Fraxinus americana*) - "Variable"**:
- Variable responses across years
- No consistent RGR increase (P = 0.47)
- May not be well-positioned to benefit

**Implications for future forest composition**:
- Red maple may increase in dominance (benefits from increased N, primarily NH₄⁺)
- Red oak may increase if NO₃⁻ continues to increase (high NRA)
- White ash may not shift significantly
- Species composition likely to change based on N form and abundance

### 6. Decoupling of NRA and Growth (Red Oak)

**Observation**:
- Red oak: Highest NRA (can use NO₃⁻)
- But: No significant growth increase yet

**Possible explanations**:
1. **Time lag**: NRA capacity present, but growth response delayed
2. **Other limitations**: N not the only limiting factor (light, water, P, etc.)
3. **C allocation**: Using NO₃⁻ but allocating C differently (not to growth)
4. **Age effects**: Mature trees may respond more slowly
5. **NO₃⁻ still minority**: Only 25% NO₃⁻ by Year 7, may need higher proportion

**Future trajectory**: May see red oak growth increase as NO₃⁻ fraction continues to rise

### 7. Shift from Summer to Winter N Cycling

**Observation**:
- Summer proportion of annual mineralization and nitrification DECREASED with warming
- Winter proportion INCREASED with warming

**Mechanism**:
- Warming most effective in winter (larger relative temperature increase)
- Soil freezing reduced or eliminated
- Microbial activity maintained during winter
- Extended N cycling season

**Implications**:
- Year-round N availability
- May favor species that can access N outside growing season
- Changes plant-microbe competition dynamics

### 8. Species-Specific N Acquisition Strategies

**Red maple strategy** (NH₄⁺-focused):
- Low NRA (limited NO₃⁻ use)
- High N resorption efficiency
- Fast growth response to increased N
- Benefits from NH₄⁺ dominance (still ~75% of mineralized N)

**Red oak strategy** (NO₃⁻-capable):
- Highest NRA (high NO₃⁻ utilization capacity)
- Moderate N resorption
- Positioned to benefit from increasing NO₃⁻ fraction
- May become more competitive as nitrification increases

**White ash strategy** (variable):
- Intermediate NRA
- Variable N resorption
- No consistent growth pattern
- May not have clear competitive advantage

**Implication**: As N form shifts (more NO₃⁻), competitive balance may shift (toward red oak)

### 9. No Evidence of Progressive N Limitation (PNL)

**PNL Theory** (Luo et al. 2004): Increased C fixation under elevated CO₂ → enhanced N sink → reduced N availability → limited CO₂ fertilization

**This study** (warming, not CO₂):
- Increased N availability (not decreased)
- Increased plant N uptake
- Increased growth (not limited)
- No PNL development

**BUT**: Warming increases N supply (mineralization), whereas CO₂ increases N demand (plant growth)

**Comparison**:
- Hovenden et al. 2008: CO₂ alone → reduced N availability (PNL)
- Butler et al. 2012: Warming alone → increased N availability (opposite)
- Dijkstra et al. 2010, Hovenden et al. 2008: Combined CO₂ + warming = complex interactions

### 10. Implications for Climate Change

**Temperature increase** alone:
- Increases N availability (mineralization)
- Shifts N form (more NO₃⁻)
- Increases plant growth (C sequestration)
- May shift species composition

**Combined climate change** (temperature + CO₂):
- CO₂ may increase plant N demand
- Warming may increase N supply
- Net effect depends on balance
- Interactions possible (see Hovenden et al. 2008)

**Species composition changes**:
- Driven by N form preference and availability
- Red maple may benefit from increased NH₄⁺ availability
- Red oak may benefit from increased NO₃⁻ availability
- Changes in dominance possible over decades

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths:
- **Large scale** (900 m² per treatment area)
- **Long duration** (7 years warming)
- **Automated temperature control** (maintained +5°C differential)
- **Comprehensive N cycle measurements** (mineralization, nitrification, solution, gaseous)
- **Species-specific tracking** (growth, foliar N, resorption, NRA)
- **Temporal resolution** (monthly N₂O, annual foliage, monthly growth)
- **Seasonal coverage** (5-week incubations spring-fall, 5-month winter)
- **Harvard Forest LTER** (iconic site, extensive supporting data)
- **Published in high-quality journal** (Oecologia)
- **Open access** (available to all)

### Limitations:

**Experimental design**:
- **Pseudoreplication**: Single large heated area vs single large control area
  - No true plot-level replication
  - Statistical power limited
  - Cannot separate treatment effect from spatial effects
  - Subplots treated as replicates (n=10), but spatially nested
- **Pre-treatment similarity**: Well-documented (2002), but single year
- **No disturbance control**: Heating cables installed by hand, but disturbance effects not formally tested (though previous smaller study showed minimal effects)

**Measurements**:
- **In situ buried bags**:
  - Net rates only (not gross rates)
  - 5-week incubation may miss short-term dynamics
  - Bags isolate soil from roots (severs plant-soil connections)
  - Potential artifacts from bag environment
- **No gross N cycling rates**:
  - Cannot assess if increased mineralization or decreased immobilization
  - ¹⁵N tracer studies would provide more mechanistic insight
  - Contrast with Dijkstra et al. (¹⁵N tracer)
- **No microbial measurements** in this study:
  - Microbial biomass and community composition from related papers (Bradford et al. 2008; Frey et al. 2008)
  - Mechanisms inferred, not directly measured
  - Contrast with Ma et al. (PLFAs measured)
- **Limited lysimeter replication**: 7 per treatment
  - Solution N highly variable
  - Power to detect small changes limited
- **N₂O near detection limits**:
  - Hard to assess if truly no effect or measurement limitation
  - More sensitive techniques might detect small increases
- **NRA single sampling**: July 2009 only
  - Seasonal variation not captured
  - One time point limits interpretation
- **No ¹⁵N natural abundance**:
  - Could track N sources and fates
  - Would complement in situ incubations

**Temporal**:
- **7 years moderate duration**:
  - Longer than many warming studies
  - But shorter than tree generation times (decades to centuries)
  - Long-term trajectories uncertain
- **Seasonal gaps**:
  - N₂O monthly April-November only
  - Lysimeters monthly only
  - Winter data limited
- **Pre-treatment only 1 year** (2002):
  - Ideally multiple pre-treatment years
  - Reduces confidence in baseline similarity

**Spatial**:
- **Single site**:
  - No geographic replication
  - Limits generalizability to other forests
  - Site-specific responses possible
- **Harvard Forest specific**:
  - Mid-aged, even-aged stand
  - May differ from old-growth or younger stands
  - Post-agricultural history (abandoned ~1908)

**Treatment**:
- **Soil warming only**:
  - Air temperature not elevated
  - Trees experience warmer roots but ambient air
  - Not fully realistic climate change
  - Decouples above- and belowground
- **+5°C warming**:
  - Larger than most climate projections (typically +2-4°C by 2100)
  - But useful for detecting responses
  - May overestimate near-term effects
- **Continuous warming**:
  - No seasonal variation in warming magnitude
  - Realistic systems: More warming in winter than summer
  - Uniform +5°C may differ from realistic patterns

**Statistical**:
- **Pseudoreplication**: Main limitation
  - Subplots within single treatment area
  - Not true independent replicates
  - Conservative interpretation needed
- **Non-parametric tests**: Appropriate given design
  - Less power than parametric
  - But robust to assumptions
- **Multiple comparisons**: Many variables tested
  - No correction applied
  - Some significant results could be Type I errors

**Interpretation**:
- **Mechanisms inferred**:
  - Nitrification increase attributed to decreased microbial immobilization
  - But not directly measured in this study
  - Alternative mechanisms possible
- **Species composition predictions**:
  - Based on 7-year responses
  - Decades to centuries needed for actual shifts
  - Other factors (climate, pests, diseases) not considered
- **Interactions with other factors**:
  - No CO₂ treatment
  - No drought treatment
  - No N addition treatment
  - Combined effects unknown

### Uncertainty Sources:
- Pseudoreplication (main source)
- Spatial variability within treatment areas
- Temporal variability (interannual)
- In situ bag method assumptions
- Lysimeter spatial variability
- N₂O near detection limits
- Single NRA sampling
- Mechanisms inferred not measured
- Long-term trajectories (beyond 7 years)
- Generalizability to other forests
- Interactions with other climate factors

## Relevance to Warming/Nitrogen Meta-Analysis

**Very high relevance**:

1. **Forest ecosystem** (first in collection):
   - Major biome for C and N cycling
   - Different from grasslands and heathlands
   - Important for global coverage

2. **Warming-only treatment**:
   - Isolates temperature effect
   - Complements CO₂ and multi-factor studies
   - Allows parsing of mechanisms

3. **Sustained N mineralization increase** (+45% over 7 years):
   - No acclimation
   - Persistent response
   - Important for long-term predictions

4. **Progressive nitrification increase** (3× by Year 5):
   - Temporal development
   - Shift in N form
   - Affects species competition

5. **Species-specific responses**:
   - Red maple "winner" (NH₄⁺ user)
   - Red oak "potential winner" (NO₃⁻ user)
   - Predicts compositional shifts

6. **Closed N cycle maintained**:
   - No N losses despite increased cycling
   - Still N-limited after 7 years
   - Differs from N-saturated systems

7. **Large scale** (900 m²):
   - Larger than most experiments
   - More realistic spatial dynamics

8. **Long duration** (7 years):
   - Longer than many studies
   - Temporal development captured

9. **Harvard Forest LTER**:
   - Iconic site
   - Extensive supporting data
   - Well-characterized

10. **Temperate deciduous forest**:
    - Major forest type in eastern North America
    - Regional importance
    - Management implications

**Integration opportunities**:
- Compare warming effects across ecosystems (forest vs grassland vs heathland)
- Test when closed N cycle maintained vs N losses occur
- Assess species-specific responses across systems
- Evaluate warming effects with and without CO₂
- Compare short-term (2-3 years) vs long-term (7 years) responses
- Test progressive changes (nitrification increase over time)
- Assess N form shifts (NH₄⁺ → NO₃⁻) and implications

## Notes

- **Harvard Forest** - one of the most studied forest sites globally (LTER since 1988)
- **Large scale** - 900 m² heated area unusually large for ecosystem warming
- **Pseudoreplication** - acknowledged limitation, but large scale reduces concern
- **Species responses** - most detailed in collection so far
- **N form shift** - progressive increase in NO₃⁻ over 7 years (important for competition)
- **Red maple "winner"** - doubled growth, benefits from increased NH₄⁺
- **Red oak "potential winner"** - high NO₃⁻ utilization, may benefit as NO₃⁻ increases
- **No acclimation** - mineralization stayed elevated for full 7 years (unlike some C cycle responses)
- **Closed N cycle** - no losses despite increased availability (still N-limited)
- **Warming alone** - isolates temperature effect (no CO₂, no N addition)
- **Implications**: Species composition may shift over decades to centuries based on N form preference
- **Related publications**: Melillo et al. 2002, 2011 (C cycle), Bradford et al. 2008, Frey et al. 2008 (microbial responses)
- **Open question**: Will nitrification continue to increase? Will red oak growth eventually respond?
- **Comparison to CO₂ studies**: Warming increases N, CO₂ may decrease N (opposite effects)
