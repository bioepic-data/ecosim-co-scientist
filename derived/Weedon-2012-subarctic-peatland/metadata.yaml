      weedon: "Doubled ammonia (year 9), sustained"

    conclusion: "Both show sustained long-term responses (contrasts with Hartley)"

  vs_danish_heathlands:
    ecosystem_difference: "Denmark: temperate heathland; Weedon: sub-arctic peatland"
    treatment_difference: "CLIMAITE: CO2 × warming × drought; Weedon: Warming only"

    N_cycling:
      climaite: "Reduced with warming + drought"
      weedon: "Enhanced with summer warming"

    key_difference: "Moisture × temperature interactions - Denmark drought dominant, Weedon moisture decrease small"

  unique_contributions:
    - "ONLY peatland study in collection"
    - "Organic-N emphasized (order of magnitude > inorganic-N)"
    - "Enzyme activities + community structure + fluxes measured simultaneously"
    - "Demonstrates disconnect between enzyme pools, community structure, and process rates"
    - "Proposes microbial biomass dynamics as key mechanism"
    - "Long-term (9 years) with sustained responses"

data_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Long-term experiment (9 years)"
    - "Factorial design with seasonal treatments"
    - "Multiple organizational levels measured simultaneously (fluxes, enzymes, biomass, community)"
    - "Incubation core method allows complete N accounting"
    - "Parallel measurements in undisturbed soil"
    - "Comprehensive molecular methods (qPCR for 7 groups, DGGE for 3)"
    - "Four peptidase enzymes measured"
    - "Both organic and inorganic N measured"

  limitations:
    experimental:
      - "Limited replication (n=5)"
      - "Pseudoreplication (blocks not true independent replicates)"
      - "Multiple treatment combinations complicate isolation of individual factors"

    incubation_method:
      - "Excludes plant uptake - may overestimate microbial N availability"
      - "Excludes leaching losses"
      - "Soil moisture captured at one time (snowmelt)"
      - "No rhizosphere processes"
      - "Small core size (5 cm × 15-20 cm) - potential edge effects"

    molecular:
      - "Resolution: domain to sub-phyla - may miss finer-scale changes"
      - "DGGE: fingerprinting, not quantitative; fungi highly variable (r=0.41)"
      - "No functional gene analysis"
      - "DNA-based: composition, not necessarily activity"

    enzyme_assays:
      - "Potential activities, not in situ"
      - "Assay conditions (pH 5, 4°C) differ from field (pH 3, variable T)"
      - "No substrate limitation - unrealistic"
      - "Only peptidases - other N-cycle enzymes not examined"

    nitrogen:
      - "NO chemical composition of organic-N fraction"
      - "Standard KEN correction (not empirically determined)"
      - "NO gross N mineralization"

    missing:
      - "NO soil respiration"
      - "NO organic N uptake by plants"
      - "NO root biomass or exudation"
      - "NO protease activities (only peptidases)"
      - "NO continuous soil moisture/temperature monitoring"

    temporal:
      - "Single year of measurements (2009) despite 9-year experiment"
      - "Only 2 time points (June, August)"
      - "NO winter or spring measurements"
