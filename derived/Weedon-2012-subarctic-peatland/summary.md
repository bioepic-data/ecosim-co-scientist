## Study Significance

This 9-year open-top chamber experiment in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum peat bog demonstrates that:

1. **Organic-N pools and fluxes are an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER than inorganic-N pools and fluxes** in peatland systems
2. **Summer warming approximately DOUBLED fluxes of soil organic nitrogen and ammonia** over the growing season with only ~1°C warming
3. **NO changes in potential peptidase enzyme activities despite doubled N fluxes** - surprising disconnect between process rates and enzyme pools
4. **Microbial community structure stable across treatments** - no detectable changes at domain to sub-phyla level
5. **Mechanism proposed: Seasonal microbial biomass dieback** - summer warming led to 21% decrease in microbial biomass from June to August, matching organic-N accumulation
6. **Q₁₀ ≈ 30 calculated for ammonia accumulation** - far exceeds typical enzyme kinetic effects (Q₁₀ ~ 2-3), indicating indirect mechanisms

**Key insight**: In peatlands where many plant species can take up organic-N directly, **organic soil N dynamics are quantitatively FAR MORE IMPORTANT than commonly studied inorganic-N dynamics**.

## Methods

### Soil Sampling Strategy

**Timing**:
- **Initial sampling**: June 4, 2009 (beginning of growing season)
- **Final sampling**: August 26, 2009 (end of growing season)
- **Additional sampling for microbial community**: August 16, 2009

**Core incubation method for N flux measurements:**
1. **June 4**: Two soil cores (5 cm diameter × 15-20 cm depth) taken per plot
   - **Core 1**: Placed in metal cylinder, capped, immediately returned to soil for in situ incubation
   - **Core 2**: Immediately processed for initial N pool measurements
2. Incubation cores regularly opened during summer to flush headspace
3. **August 26**: Incubation cores retrieved and processed for final N pool measurements
4. **August 16**: Additional core taken near incubation location for DNA extraction and enzyme assays

**Purpose of incubation core method:**
- Excludes plant uptake and leaching losses
- Allows complete accounting of changes in N pool sizes over growing season
- Necessary artifact: May exclude important rhizosphere N cycling processes

### Nitrogen Pool Measurements

**Three separate subsamples** (5 g fresh weight each) from homogenized cores:

**Subsample 1: Fumigated (for microbial biomass N)**
- Fumigated with chloroform for 5 days
- Extracted in 25.0 mL 0.5 M K₂SO₄ (2 hours shaking)
- Digested in potassium persulfate
- **Total extractable N** = microbial + organic + inorganic

**Subsample 2: Unfumigated, digested (for organic + inorganic N)**
- Extracted in 25.0 mL 0.5 M K₂SO₄ (2 hours shaking)
- Digested in potassium persulfate
- **Non-microbial extractable N** = organic + inorganic

**Subsample 3: Unfumigated, undigested (for inorganic N)**
- Extracted in 25.0 mL 1 M KCl (2 hours)
- **Inorganic N** = NH₄⁺ + NO₃⁻

**Analytical measurements:**
- **Ammonia and nitrate**: SA-40 auto-analyzer (Skalar, Breda, The Netherlands)

**Calculations:**
```
N_inorganic = Ammonia + Nitrate (unfumigated, undigested)

N_organic = Nitrate (unfumigated, digested) - N_inorganic

N_microbial = [Nitrate (fumigated, digested) - N_organic - N_inorganic] / K_EN
```

**Correction factor**: K_EN = 0.45 (standard for incomplete solubilization of biomass N; Jenkinson et al. 2004)

**Seasonal fluxes**: Calculated as difference between August and June pool sizes

## Results

### Soil Nitrogen Fluxes (Seasonal Accumulation in Incubation Cores)

#### Organic Nitrogen (Dissolved Organic N)

**Magnitude**: An **order of magnitude HIGHER** than inorganic-N pools and fluxes

**Summer warming effect** (highly significant, F₁,₁₆ = 10.03, P < 0.01):
- **AA (control)**: ~0.06 mg N g⁻¹ DW soil per season
- **AS (snow/spring warming)**: ~0.09 mg N g⁻¹ DW
- **WA (summer warming)**: ~0.16 mg N g⁻¹ DW (**+165% vs AA**)
- **WS (summer warming + snow/spring)**: ~0.12 mg N g⁻¹ DW (**+79% vs AS**)

**Interaction**: Significant summer × winter/spring interaction (F₁,₁₆ = 5.0, P < 0.05)
- Opposite effects of winter/spring treatments under different summer conditions

**Undisturbed soil**: NO treatment effect on seasonal organic N accumulation in undisturbed cores sampled adjacent to incubation cores

#### Ammonia (Net N Mineralization)

**Magnitude**: Order of magnitude LOWER than organic-N

**Summer warming effect** (highly significant, F₁,₁₆ = 14.65, P < 0.01):
- **AA + AS (summer ambient)**: Mean ~0.005 mg N g⁻¹ DW per season
- **WA + WS (summer warmed)**: Mean ~0.013 mg N g⁻¹ DW (**+110% increase**)

**Winter/spring effect** (significant, F₁,₁₆ = 13.11, P < 0.01):
- Snow addition + spring warming **decreased** ammonia accumulation

**NO interaction** between summer and winter/spring treatments

#### Nitrate

**Magnitude**: Similar order of magnitude to ammonia

**Treatment effects**: **NO significant effects** of any treatments on nitrate accumulation

**Note**: Detection of nitrate accumulation is surprising, as nitrate pathways usually assumed negligible in peatlands

#### Calculated Q₁₀

**For ammonia accumulation** between WA and AA plots over ~1.5°C difference:
- **Q₁₀ ≈ 30**

**Interpretation**: Far exceeds typical enzyme kinetic Q₁₀ values (2-3), suggesting response is NOT due to direct temperature effects on enzyme reaction rates but rather to **indirect effects** of warming

### Enzyme Activities (Potential Peptidase Activities at 4°C)

**Range of activities**:
- **Lowest**: Lys-Ala = 4.5 nmol g⁻¹ DW soil h⁻¹
- **Highest**: Ala-Ala-Phe (AAP) = 134.3 nmol g⁻¹ DW soil h⁻¹

#### Seasonal Changes (June → August)

**Significant decreases** in 3 of 4 enzymes (month P < 0.05):
- **Leu**: Reduced to **50%** of June levels
- **Ala**: Reduced to **70%** of June levels (30% decrease)
- **AAP**: Reduced to **68%** of June levels (32% decrease)
- **Lys-Ala**: NO significant change

**Leu interaction** with winter treatment (winter × month, F₁,₁₆ = 4.77, P < 0.05):
- Greater activity reduction in WA and AA (54% of June) than in WS and AS (41%)

#### Treatment Effects

**Summer warming**: **NO effect** on mean enzymatic potentials
- Neither as main effect nor in interactions with other treatments or time

**Winter/spring treatment**: NO consistent effects

**Key finding**: Despite ~100% increase in organic-N and ammonia fluxes with summer warming, **NO changes in potential peptidase enzyme activities**

### Microbial Biomass Nitrogen

**Absolute pool size** (mg N g⁻¹ DW soil):
- **June**: ~0.5-0.6 across all treatments
- **August**: ~0.45-0.6 across all treatments

**Seasonal change** - significant summer × month interaction (F₁,₁₆ = 4.82, P < 0.05):

**Summer ambient plots (AA, AS)**:
- Mean **1.5% decrease** from June to August

**Summer warmed plots (WA, WS)**:
- Mean **21% decrease** from June to August

**Absolute changes closely match organic-N accumulation:**
- **WA plots**: Lost 0.14 mg N g⁻¹ DW from microbial pool, accumulated 0.16 mg N g⁻¹ DW in organic-N pool
- **WS plots**: Lost 0.11 mg N g⁻¹ DW from microbial pool, accumulated 0.12 mg N g⁻¹ DW in organic-N pool

**Undisturbed soil**: Seasonal decrease in microbial N pool in ALL treatments, but **significantly greater (45%) in summer warmed plots vs 22% in ambient** (Appendix S1)

**Winter/spring treatment**: NO significant effects

### Microbial Community Structure

#### qPCR - Relative Abundance of Taxonomic Groups

- **Betaproteobacteria**: Mean **1.1%**

**Fungi vs Bacteria:**
- **Fungal:Eubacterial ratio**: Mean 0.64:1 (range 0.36:1 to 1.4:1)

**Archaea vs Bacteria:**
- **Eubacterial:Archaeal ratio**: ~3500:1 (at lower end of known soil archaeal abundance across 3 continents)

**Treatment effects:**

**Alphaproteobacteria** (significant, F₁,₁₆ = 11.02, P < 0.01):
- Plots with **winter snow + spring warming had LOWER proportions**
- Independent of sampling date and summer treatment

**Betaproteobacteria** (significant, F₁,₁₆ = 7.25, P < 0.05):
- Plots with **winter snow + spring warming had LOWER proportions**
- Independent of sampling date and summer treatment

**All other groups**: NO significant effects of treatments or seasonal change

**Permutational MANOVA** (all 6 groups together):
- **NO significant effects** of sampling time or treatments (all terms P > 0.05)

#### DGGE Profiles

**Target groups** (3 most abundant):
1. Acidobacteria
2. Actinobacteria
3. Fungi

**Profile variability** (mean Pearson correlation coefficient, all pairwise comparisons):
- **Fungi**: 0.41 (highly variable)
- **Acidobacteria**: 0.70 (less variable)
- **Actinobacteria**: 0.62 (less variable)

**Treatment and time effects:**
- **Permutational MANOVA**: NO significant effects for any individual profile type or all three combined (all models, all terms P > 0.05)

**Conclusion**: Microbial community structure at domain to sub-phyla level **stable across treatments and seasons** despite large changes in N fluxes

---

## Discussion and Interpretation

### Experimental Climate Change → Doubled N Accumulation Rates

**Key result**: Summer warming approximately **doubled** accumulation of both organic nitrogen and ammonia in incubation cores relative to ambient

**Comparison to previous warming studies:**
- Result echoes previous observations of positive warming effects on N mineralization (Schmidt et al. 1999, Rustad et al. 2001)
- **Magnitude of effect**: ~100% increase
  - Higher than general increases found in meta-analysis: 46% for N mineralization, 20% for soil respiration (Rustad et al. 2001)
  - Comparable to effects on carbon flux at same site (Dorrepaal et al. 2009)

**Implications for plant nutrition:**
- Organic nitrogen = important source of nutrition in N-poor systems (Lipson & Näsholm 2001, Clemmensen et al. 2008)
- Strong warming effects likely contributed to sustained positive effect of summer warming on Sphagnum moss and Betula nana growth in same plots (Keuper et al. 2011)

**Nitrate accumulation:**
- Surprising finding - nitrate pathways usually assumed negligible in peatland systems (Rosswall & Granhall 1980, Limpens et al. 2006)
- Merits closer examination
- In absolute terms, magnitude was order of magnitude lower than organic-N

**Quantitative importance:**
- **Organic-N fluxes >> inorganic-N fluxes** (order of magnitude difference)
- Reinforces idea that **measuring organic nitrogen turnover** more informative than only measuring N mineralization in these systems (Jonasson & Shaver 1999, Schimel & Bennett 2004, Nannipieri & Eldor 2009)

### Q₁₀ Argument: Not Simple Temperature Kinetics

**Calculated Q₁₀** for ammonia accumulation between WA and AA: **~30**

**Standard biological Q₁₀**: 2-3

**Soil moisture change**: Only ~1% by weight over season - unlikely to explain patterns

**Conclusion**: **Much larger effect than expected from enzyme kinetics alone**

**Proposed explanation**: Indirect effects of temperature:
1. **Non-linear dynamics** of soil processes close to freezing point (Jefferies et al. 2010)
2. **Indirect effects via substrate input** and microbial biomass dynamics (see below)
3. **Positive feedback**: Increased N mobilization → accelerated N-limited decomposition

### Implications for Peatland Carbon Balance

**Northern peatlands status:**
- **15-30% of global soil carbon pool** (Gorham 1991, Turunen et al. 2002)
- Currently a **carbon sink**
- Low decomposition rates due to: low temperatures, low O₂, functionally limited decomposer communities, recalcitrant substrates, low N concentrations

**Potential for positive feedback loop:**
- Warming → accelerated decomposition → mobilized organic N → further accelerated decomposition
- Could shift peatlands from **carbon sink to carbon source**

**Countervailing process:**
- Plant productivity also N-limited (Chapin et al. 1995, Shaver & Chapin 1995, van Wijk et al. 2004)
- Increased N supply → increased C storage in vegetation/litter (Melillo et al. 2002)
- Or eventual changes to plant community structure (Aerts 2010)

**Microbial competition:**
- Microorganisms routinely identified as **stronger competitor** for increased soil N (Zak et al. 1990, Schmidt et al. 1999, McFarland et al. 2010)

**Authors' note**: Data do not allow discrimination between C sink vs source scenarios

### NO Changes in Enzyme Pools or Microbial Community Structure

**Surprising result**: Large, consistent effect of summer warming on N flux rates, but:
- **NO changes in potential peptidase activities**
- **NO changes in microbial community structure** (domain to sub-phyla level)

#### Enzyme Activities: Insensitive to Warming

**Findings**:
- Potential peptidase activities **insensitive** to 9 years of climate manipulations
- Despite being used as indicators of N cycling in many studies

**Similar findings in temperate ombrotrophic bogs:**
- No strong association between seasonal soil temperature and extracellular enzyme activities (Bonnett et al. 2006)
- No significant effects of 3°C warming on phenol oxidase and β-glucosidase (Fenner et al. 2007)

**Enzyme activity controls in peatlands:**
- Controlled more by: soil oxygen content, ionic concentrations, presence of suppressive compounds (Freeman et al. 2001, Bonnett et al. 2006)
- NOT by temperature (at least not potential activities)

**Evidence from other warming experiments:**
- Potential activities either insensitive (Bell et al. 2010, Bell & Henry 2011)
- Limited to certain enzymes (Allison et al. 2010)
- Or small relative to interannual variation (Gutknecht et al. 2010)

#### Possible Interpretations

**Interpretation 1: Increased substrate supply**
- Warming → increased peptide substrate from:
  - Increased soil protease activity (Weintraub & Schimel 2005)
  - Enhanced plant litter input
  - Enhanced root exudation/turnover
  - **Microbial biomass turnover** (see below)

**Interpretation 2: Non-peptide organic-N components**
- Heterocyclic N may make up ~35% of soil organic-N (Schulten & Schnitzer 1998)
- Processed by enzymatic pathways NOT examined in this study
- Would require detailed chemical composition analysis of organic-N fraction

**Interpretation 3: In situ activity increases**
- Despite no change in potential activity, realized in situ activities may have increased
- Due to direct temperature effects on enzyme kinetics
- However, authors argue this insufficient to explain ~100% flux increase over ~1.5°C with insignificant pH changes

#### Microbial Community Structure: Stable

**Findings**:
- 9 years of climate manipulations had **NO detectable effect** on microbial community structure
- At resolution of: Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi (domains); Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria (phyla/classes)

**Minor effects detected:**
- Alpha and Betaproteobacteria: Lower in plots with winter snow + spring warming
- But NO effects of summer warming (main driver of N flux changes)

**qPCR and DGGE methods:**
- Have been shown sensitive to differences along large-scale gradients (Muyzer & Smalla 1998, Fierer et al. 2005, 2007, 2009, Yergeau et al. 2007)
- But insensitive to climate manipulations at this site

**Comparison to nearby site:**
- Similar temperature manipulations at nearby heath tundra site detected community changes only after **15 years** (Rinnan et al. 2007)
- Suggests **long time lag** (possibly mediated by decade-scale vegetation dynamics)

**Implications:**
- Higher resolution methods might reveal treatment effects
- BUT enzyme results indicate **functional redundancy** with respect to peptidase production
- Changes at finer taxonomic resolution would not explain large flux changes

### Mechanism: Non-Specific Microbial Mortality

**Key observation**: Summer warming effect on organic-N flux **mirrored by decrease** in microbial biomass N pool of almost identical magnitude

**Microbial biomass dynamics:**

**Summer warmed plots (WA, WS):**
- Attain **higher peak biomass** early in season (June)
- Decrease through microbial mortality
- Biomass **equivalent to ambient** at end of season (August)

**Summer ambient plots (AA, AS):**
- Lower peak biomass
- Relatively stable through season

**Mortality appears non-specific:**
- NOT associated with detectable changes to microbial community structure
- In major taxonomic groups examined (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fungi)

#### Previous Studies on Microbial Biomass Dynamics

**Late-winter and spring thaw dynamics:**
- Nitrogen economy of annually frozen soils greatly influenced by microbial biomass dynamics (Zak et al. 1990, Deluca et al. 1992, Brooks et al. 1998)
- Lipson et al. (1999), Jefferies et al. (2010): Labile C and N fluxes following spring thaw

**This study:**
- Winter snow depth and spring temperature manipulations **less important** than summer warming
- Different from previous emphasis on winter/spring processes

#### Proposed Mechanism

**Indirect summer warming effects:**

1. **Increased plant litter input** during growing season (Brooks et al. 2005)
2. **Increased root exudation** during growing season (Nguyen 2003)
3. ↓
4. **Greater flux of labile C and N** following spring thaw (Lipson et al. 1999, Jefferies et al. 2010)
5. ↓
6. **Higher summer peak microbial biomass** (June)
7. ↓
8. **Non-specific microbial mortality** late in season
9. ↓
10. **Enhanced N fluxes** (observed doubling of organic-N and ammonia)

**Key**: Link between **growing season substrate inputs → overwintering microbial biomass → spring thaw flush → summer peak biomass → late-season dieback**

### Implications of Proposed Mechanism

**Implication 1: Mechanism for warming effects on soil respiration and N mineralization**
- Related to **altered seasonal behavior** of microbial biomass
- Rather than: direct temperature effects, or mobilization of older recalcitrant SOM (Dorrepaal et al. 2009)

**Implication 2: Contrast to common paradigm**
- **Common view**: Global change effects on soil function mediated by **changes in microbial community structure** (Schimel & Gulledge 1998, Allison & Martiny 2008)
- **This study**: Microbial communities and enzyme pools **unaffected** by climate change, yet produce **large range in biogeochemical flux magnitudes** due to those same treatments

**Implication 3: Research focus recommendations**
- Focus on effects of climate change on:
  - **Quantity, timing, and composition** of substrate inputs (litter, root exudates, microbial biomass turnover)
  - Their interplay with enzyme activities and community structure

**Implication 4: Need for in situ labeling experiments**
- Use labeled N compounds (e.g., Whiteside et al. 2009, Rütting et al. 2011)
- Test hypothesized relationship between seasonal microbial biomass die-off and organic N fluxes
- Allow measurements with rhizosphere influences (plant uptake, rhizodeposition; Jonasson et al. 2004)

- Leu, Ala, Lys-Ala, AAP all insensitive to summer warming

**Seasonal changes**: 30-50% decrease from June to August (BUT similar across treatments)

**Disconnect**: Large flux changes WITHOUT corresponding enzyme pool changes

### 4. Microbial Community Structure Stable

**qPCR**: Only minor effects on Alpha and Betaproteobacteria (winter/spring treatment)
- NO effects of summer warming

**DGGE**: NO effects on Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, or Fungi profiles

**Permutational MANOVA**: NO significant treatment or time effects

**Resolution**: Domain to sub-phyla level stable despite large biogeochemical changes

### 5. Mechanism: Seasonal Microbial Biomass Dieback

**Summer warmed plots**:
- 21% decrease in microbial biomass N from June to August
- Closely matches organic-N accumulation (WA: 0.14 mg lost = 0.16 mg accumulated)

**Summer ambient plots**:
- Only 1.5% decrease

**Non-specific mortality**: NO changes in community structure

**Proposed mechanism**: Warming → increased substrate inputs → higher peak microbial biomass → late-season dieback → enhanced N fluxes

### 6. Implications for Peatland C Balance

**Potential positive feedback**:
- Warming → decomposition → N mobilization → further decomposition
- Could shift peatlands from C sink to C source

**Strong effects on both C and N**:
- ~100% increase in both C respiration (Dorrepaal et al. 2009) and N fluxes (this study)

**Uncertainty**:
- Whether increased N availability → increased plant C storage vs increased decomposition

## Relevance to EcoSIM Modeling

### 1. Organic vs Inorganic N Dynamics

**Critical finding**: Organic-N fluxes >> inorganic-N fluxes (order of magnitude) in peatland systems

**Implications for models:**
- **Must explicitly represent organic-N pools and fluxes** in peatland simulations
- Cannot rely solely on inorganic N (NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻) dynamics
- Many peatland plants capable of direct organic-N uptake (bypassing full mineralization)

**EcoSIM parameterization:**
- Need separate organic-N depolymerization rates
- Peptidase enzyme dynamics
- Direct plant uptake of organic-N compounds

### 2. Indirect Temperature Effects

**Q₁₀ ≈ 30** calculated for ammonia flux far exceeds enzyme kinetics (Q₁₀ ~ 2-3)

**Implications:**
- **Cannot model temperature effects as simple Arrhenius/Q₁₀ relationships**
- Must include **indirect effects**:
  - Non-linear dynamics near freezing
  - Substrate supply changes
  - Microbial biomass dynamics
  - Positive feedbacks (N-limited decomposition)

**Challenge**: How to mechanistically represent these indirect effects in models?

### 3. Microbial Biomass Dynamics as Key Driver

**Finding**: Seasonal microbial biomass dieback drove N flux increases, NOT enzyme production or community shifts

**Implications for models:**
- **Explicit representation of microbial biomass** essential
- Seasonal dynamics of biomass growth and mortality
- **Substrate inputs** driving microbial growth:
  - Plant litter
  - Root exudation
  - Root turnover
- **Overwintering processes** and spring flush dynamics

**EcoSIM should include:**
- Microbial biomass C and N pools
- Growth and mortality rates
- Seasonal variation in substrate supply
- Microbial biomass as N source (through mortality) as well as N sink (through immobilization)

### 4. Disconnect Between Enzyme Pools and Process Rates

**Finding**: Doubled N fluxes with NO changes in potential enzyme activities

**Implications:**
- **Enzyme pool size alone insufficient predictor** of process rates
- Must also consider:
  - **Substrate availability** (limitation)
  - **In situ enzyme activity** (vs potential)
  - **Environmental controls** (pH, O₂, temperature, moisture, inhibitors)

**Model complexity:**
- Trade-off between mechanistic detail (enzyme kinetics) and pragmatic representation (bulk process rates)
- This study suggests substrate supply and microbial biomass dynamics MORE important than enzyme pool size

### 5. Functional Redundancy in Microbial Communities

**Finding**: NO changes in community structure despite large functional changes

**Implications:**
- **Functional redundancy** at phylum/class level for peptidase production
- Models may NOT need to explicitly represent microbial community composition changes for N cycling
- **Exception**: Might be important for other processes (e.g., methanogenesis, specific biogeochemical transformations)

**EcoSIM parameterization:**
- Can potentially use aggregate microbial parameters
- Community composition changes may not be necessary for peatland N cycling predictions

### 6. Seasonal Substrate Dynamics

**Proposed mechanism emphasizes**: Quantity, timing, and composition of substrate inputs

**Critical for models:**
- **Plant litter inputs**: Seasonal timing, quantity, quality (C:N, lignin content)
- **Root processes**:
  - Exudation rates (seasonal variation)
  - Root turnover
- **Microbial substrates**:
  - Labile vs recalcitrant C
  - Protein vs other organic N forms
  - Seasonal availability

**EcoSIM should track:**
- Multiple substrate pools with different decomposition rates
- Seasonal variation in substrate input rates
- Coupling between plant phenology and substrate supply

### 7. Peatland-Specific Processes

**Peatland characteristics to represent:**
- **Ombrotrophic** (rain-fed, very low nutrient inputs)
- **Acidic** (pH ~3)
- **Anaerobic** in deeper layers
- **Sphagnum-dominated** (unique litter chemistry)
- **Low decomposition rates** (multiple limiting factors)

**Comparison to other ecosystems:**
- Lower N mineralization than temperate forests (Peterjohn, Butler)
- Lower than Arctic tundra with nutrient additions (Chapin)
- But organic-N dynamics quantitatively more important

**Cross-site validation:**
- Use Abisko peatland data alongside:
  - Arctic tundra (Chapin)
  - Subarctic heath (Hartley)
  - Temperate forests (Peterjohn, Butler)
- Test whether same model structure captures different ecosystem responses

### 8. Winter and Spring Processes

**This study showed**: Winter snow + spring warming less important than summer warming for N cycling

**But previous studies emphasized**: Importance of winter/spring dynamics for microbial N

**Models must include:**
- Freeze-thaw cycles
- Snow insulation effects on soil temperature
- Spring thaw dynamics
- Overwintering microbial biomass
- Link between growing season inputs and overwintering processes

### 9. Time Lags and Long-Term Responses

**9-year experiment**: Still showing responses to treatments

**Implications:**
- **Long equilibration times** for peatland processes
- Short-term experiments may miss important dynamics
- Models need to account for:
  - Legacy effects
  - Slow SOM turnover
  - Decade-scale vegetation changes
  - Multi-year substrate accumulation

### 10. Methodological Considerations

**Incubation core method:**
- Excludes plant uptake and leaching
- Allows complete N budget
- BUT excludes rhizosphere processes

**Models calibrated to incubation data:**
- May overestimate N availability to microbes
- Miss plant-microbe competition in rhizosphere
- Should be validated against field measurements with plant uptake

**Potential enzyme activities:**
- Measured at pH 5, 4°C without substrate limitation
- Very different from in situ conditions (pH 3, variable temperature, substrate-limited)
- Models should focus on in situ process rates rather than potential activities

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths

1. **Long-term experiment** (9 years) - captures sustained responses
2. **Factorial design** with seasonal treatments (spring, summer, winter)
3. **Multiple levels of organization** measured simultaneously:
   - N fluxes
   - Enzyme activities
   - Microbial biomass
   - Community structure (qPCR + DGGE)
4. **Incubation core method** allows complete N accounting
5. **Parallel measurements** in undisturbed soil (checks for artifacts)
6. **Comprehensive molecular methods** (qPCR for 7 taxonomic groups, DGGE for 3)
7. **Four peptidase enzymes** measured
8. **Both organic and inorganic N** measured

### Limitations

#### Experimental Design
1. **Limited replication** (n = 5 per treatment)
2. **Pseudoreplication**: Blocks not true independent replicates (slope position)
3. **Multiple treatment combinations**: Difficult to isolate individual factor effects

#### Incubation Core Method
1. **Excludes plant uptake** - may overestimate microbial N availability
2. **Excludes leaching losses** - may overestimate N retention
3. **Soil moisture captured at one time** (snowmelt) - may not reflect seasonal variation
4. **No rhizosphere processes** - misses plant-microbe interactions
5. **Small core size** (5 cm diameter × 15-20 cm) - potential edge effects

#### Molecular Methods
1. **Resolution**: qPCR at domain to sub-phyla level - may miss finer-scale community changes
2. **DGGE limitations**:
   - Fingerprinting, not quantitative
   - Highly variable for fungi (Pearson r = 0.41)
3. **No functional gene analysis** (e.g., proteases, N-cycle genes)
4. **DNA-based**: Represents community composition, not necessarily activity

#### Enzyme Assays
1. **Potential activities** measured, not in situ activities
2. **Assay conditions** (pH 5, 4°C) differ from field (pH 3, variable temperature)
3. **No substrate limitation** - unrealistic
4. **Only peptidases** measured - other N-cycle enzymes not examined
5. **Limited set of substrates** (4 peptidases) - may not capture full peptidase pool diversity

#### N Pool Measurements
1. **NO information on chemical composition** of organic-N fraction
   - Cannot distinguish peptides from heterocyclic N
2. **Chloroform fumigation-extraction** for microbial biomass:
   - Standard KEN = 0.45 used (not empirically determined for this soil)
   - May have errors in absolute values
3. **NO gross N mineralization** measurements - only net

#### Missing Measurements
1. **NO soil respiration data** (would complement N flux data)
2. **NO gross N mineralization or immobilization rates**
3. **NO organic N uptake by plants** measured
4. **NO root biomass or exudation** measurements
5. **NO protease activities** (only peptidases)
6. **NO measurements of: heterocyclic N, dissolved organic C, other nutrients (P)**
7. **NO continuous soil moisture or temperature** monitoring

#### Temporal
1. **Single year of measurements** (2009) - despite 9-year experiment
2. **Only 2 time points** (June, August) - miss fine-scale seasonal dynamics
3. **NO winter or spring measurements**

#### Interpretation
1. **Mechanism for microbial dieback unclear** - proposed but not definitively tested
2. **Substrate composition unknown** - cannot determine if litter quality changed
3. **Cannot distinguish contributions** of different substrate sources (litter vs roots vs microbial biomass)
4. **Correlation between microbial biomass loss and organic-N accumulation** - suggestive but not proof of causation

### Data Availability
- **Published data**: Summary statistics (means, SE) in figures
- **Raw data**: Not provided in publication
- **Supplementary information**: Appendices S1-S2 (undisturbed soil data, NMDS plots)
- **For modeling**: Would need to contact authors for raw data

## Comparison to Other Studies in Collection

### vs Hartley 1999 (Subarctic Heath)
**Both sub-arctic Sweden, but different ecosystems:**
- **Hartley**: Dwarf shrub heath, dry, 5°C soil warming, 5 years
- **Weedon**: Sphagnum peatland/bog, wet, ~1°C air warming (OTCs), 9 years

**N mineralization:**
- Hartley: Doubled in year 2, disappeared by year 5
- Weedon: Doubled (ammonia) in year 9, sustained

**Temporal dynamics:**
- Hartley: Short-term ≠ long-term
- Weedon: Effect sustained at least 9 years

**Mechanisms:**
- Hartley: Unclear (microbial biomass increase? labile C depletion?)
- Weedon: Seasonal microbial biomass dieback proposed

### vs Chapin 1995 (Arctic Tundra)
**Both high-latitude, but different approaches:**
- **Chapin**: Nutrient addition (HIGH dose: 10 g N m⁻² + 5 g P m⁻² yr⁻¹), greenhouse warming
- **Weedon**: No nutrient addition, OTC warming

**N availability:**
- Chapin: Added 10 g N m⁻² yr⁻¹ = 100 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹
- Weedon: Warming increased mineralization ~0.005 mg g⁻¹ = ~5-10 kg N ha⁻¹ (order of magnitude lower)

**Community change:**
- Chapin: 30-50% species loss, major shifts
- Weedon: NO plant species composition change after 9 years (Keuper et al. 2011)

**Supports**: Fertilization studies overestimate warming effects

### vs Peterjohn 1994 & Butler 2012 (Harvard Forest)
**Temperate forest vs sub-arctic peatland:**
- **Harvard Forest**: Buried cables, +5°C soil, deciduous forest
- **Weedon**: OTCs, ~+1°C air, Sphagnum bog

**N mineralization:**
- Peterjohn: Doubled in forest floor + mineral soil (first 6 months)
- Butler: Sustained 7 years
- Weedon: Doubled ammonia (year 9), sustained

**Temporal dynamics:**
- Harvard Forest: Sustained long-term (at least 7 years per Butler)
- Weedon: Sustained long-term (at least 9 years)

**Both show sustained responses**, contrasts with Hartley (disappeared by year 5)

### vs Danish Heathlands (Andresen 2010, Larsen 2011)
**Both heathlands, but different climates:**
- **Denmark**: Temperate heathland, CLIMAITE (CO₂ × warming × drought)
- **Weedon**: Sub-arctic peatland, OTCs

**N cycling:**
- CLIMAITE: Reduced N cycling with warming + drought
- Weedon: Enhanced N cycling with summer warming

**Key difference**: Moisture × temperature interactions
- Denmark: Drought effect dominant
- Weedon: Moisture decrease small (~1%), summer warming effect dominant

### Unique Contributions of Weedon 2012

1. **Only peatland study** in collection (vs heaths, forests, grasslands, tundra)
2. **Organic-N emphasized** - order of magnitude > inorganic-N
3. **Enzyme activities + community structure + fluxes** measured simultaneously
4. **Demonstrates disconnect** between enzyme pools, community structure, and process rates
5. **Proposes microbial biomass dynamics** as key mechanism
6. **Long-term (9 years)** with sustained responses

## Conclusions

This 9-year open-top chamber experiment in a sub-arctic Swedish peatland demonstrates that:

1. **In ombrotrophic Sphagnum bogs, organic-N pools and fluxes are quantitatively FAR MORE IMPORTANT (order of magnitude) than inorganic-N pools and fluxes**

2. **Summer warming (~1°C air temperature increase) approximately doubled seasonal fluxes of both organic nitrogen and ammonia**, with Q₁₀ ≈ 30 suggesting indirect mechanisms rather than simple enzyme kinetics

3. **Large changes in N cycling occurred WITHOUT any changes in potential peptidase enzyme activities or microbial community structure** at the domain to sub-phyla level, demonstrating a surprising disconnect between ecosystem function and traditionally measured microbial properties

4. **Seasonal dynamics of microbial biomass appear to drive N flux changes**: Summer warmed plots showed 21% decrease in microbial biomass N from June to August (closely matching organic-N accumulation), suggesting **non-specific late-season microbial dieback** as the mechanism

5. **Understanding climate change effects on organic soil N cycling in peatlands will be advanced by**:
   - Closer investigation of seasonal microbial biomass dynamics
   - Quantity, timing, and composition of substrate inputs (litter, root exudates, microbial biomass turnover)
   - Their interplay rather than focusing on enzyme pools or community composition

6. **Potential implications for peatland carbon balance**: Strong amplification of both C and N fluxes (~100% increases) suggests potential for positive feedback loops, with uncertain consequences for whether peatlands remain a C sink or become a C source

**This study challenges the common paradigm** that ecosystem functional responses to climate change are mediated primarily through changes in microbial community structure and enzyme production, instead highlighting the importance of substrate dynamics and microbial biomass turnover.
