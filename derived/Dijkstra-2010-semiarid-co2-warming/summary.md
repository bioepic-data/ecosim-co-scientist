## Major Findings

### 1. Contrasting Effects of CO₂ vs Warming

**Elevated CO₂ → MORE CLOSED N cycle**:
- Decreased soil inorganic N (-17% to -38%)
- Decreased PRS-available N (-36% to -54%)
- Increased microbial NO₃⁻ immobilization (+186%)
- No change in plant N pools
- **Mechanism**: CO₂ → increased soil moisture → increased microbial immobilization

**Warming → MORE OPEN N cycle**:
- Increased soil inorganic N (+31% to +63% in summer)
- Increased PRS-available N (+100% in 2007)
- Increased plant N pools (+22% in 2008)
- No change in microbial NO₃⁻ immobilization
- **Mechanism**: Direct temperature stimulation of gross and net mineralization > indirect soil moisture reduction

### 2. No CO₂ × Warming Interactions

**Additive effects observed** for:
- Soil inorganic N pool sizes
- PRS-available N
- Plant N pool sizes
- Plant and microbial NO₃⁻ uptake

**Contrast with other studies**:
- Hovenden et al. (2008) found significant CO₂ × warming interaction in temperate Tasmania grassland
- Our results support DAYCENT model predictions (Parton et al. 2007) of additive effects

### 3. Soil Moisture as Key Mediator

**CO₂ effect mediated by soil moisture**:
- Elevated CO₂ increased soil moisture (+2.36% v/v)
- Irrigation had similar effects to elevated CO₂:
  - Increased microbial ¹⁵N recovery (+119%, marginal)
  - Decreased PRS-available N in 2007 (-61%)
  - Decreased soil inorganic N in August 2008 (-43% at 0-5 cm)
- Suggests CO₂-induced moisture increase caused increased microbial immobilization

**Warming effect dominated by temperature**:
- Warming decreased soil moisture (-1.3% v/v)
- But still increased soil inorganic N and plant N
- Direct temperature stimulation of mineralization > moisture reduction effect
- Parton et al. (2007) predicted temperature more important than moisture for warming effects

### 4. Microbial Immobilization Key to CO₂ Response

**Elevated CO₂**:
- No change in total plant ¹⁵N uptake
- Large increase in microbial ¹⁵N uptake (+186%)
- Increased microbial biomass N at surface (+23%)
- **Conclusion**: Reduced soil inorganic N under CO₂ due to microbial immobilization, NOT increased plant uptake

**Implications**:
- Supports concept of Progressive Nitrogen Limitation (PNL)
- Short-term (3 years): Microbial immobilization reduces N availability
- Long-term: Could constrain CO₂ fertilization effect
- BUT: Some studies show sustained N mineralization increase under CO₂ (Dijkstra et al. 2008 - 5 years in Colorado semiarid grassland)

### 5. Seasonal and Temporal Patterns

**CO₂ effects**:
- Consistent across all measurement dates
- Stronger in mid-summer than spring

**Warming effects**:
- Strong in mid-summer (August 2007, 2008)
- Weak or absent in spring (April 2008)
- Plant activity low in early spring → less N uptake → inorganic N accumulates

**Interannual consistency**:
- Patterns generally consistent 2007-2008
- Some development over time (e.g., root biomass increase under CO₂ only in 2008)

### 6. Delayed Transport of ¹⁵N Under Warming

**Warming decreased shoot ¹⁵N recovery** (-28%, P=0.07):
- Despite increased shoot N pool
- And increased root ¹⁵N recovery (+40%)
- **Interpretation**: Delayed transport from roots to shoots (48-hour harvest may have been too soon)

### 7. No Evidence for Progressive N Limitation Yet

**After 3 years of elevated CO₂**:
- Plant N pools unchanged
- Root biomass increased in 2008 (+33%)
- Possible increased soil exploration by roots → maintained N uptake
- BUT: Did not measure root length density (needed to confirm)

**Contrast with predictions**:
- PNL theory suggests N limitation should develop (Luo et al. 2004, Reich et al. 2006)
- Some studies show reduced inorganic N → eventual growth limitation
- Others show sustained N mineralization increase (Dijkstra et al. 2008, Ebersberger et al. 2003)

### 8. Model Predictions Generally Supported

**DAYCENT model (Parton et al. 2007) predicted**:
- ✓ Elevated CO₂ increases soil moisture (confirmed)
- ✓ Elevated CO₂ increases N mineralization (not yet observed at 3 years)
- ✓ Warming decreases soil moisture (confirmed)
- ✓ Warming increases N mineralization (confirmed)
- ✓ Additive effects (no CO₂ × warming interactions) (confirmed)
- **Novel finding**: Elevated CO₂ actually DECREASED soil inorganic N (due to microbial immobilization)

### 9. Comparison Across Ecosystems

**Semiarid grassland** (this study) vs **Mesic ecosystems**:
- Similar patterns for warming (increased mineralization)
- Different for elevated CO₂ (moisture relief more important in semiarid)
- Water limitation critical mediator

**Compared to other semiarid studies**:
- Epstein et al. (2002), Burke et al. (2008): Decomposition DECREASED with natural temperature gradient
  - Suggests moisture limitation can override temperature stimulation
  - Our experimental warming: Temperature > moisture effects
- Verburg et al. (2009): Tallgrass prairie, warming had no effect on soil N
  - Attributed to moisture reduction offsetting temperature increase
  - Our study: Temperature effects dominated

### Model Testing Opportunities

1. **Can EcoSIM reproduce contrasting CO₂ vs warming effects**?
   - CO₂ → closed N cycle (decreased inorganic N)
   - Warming → open N cycle (increased inorganic N)
   - Requires capturing both plant and microbial responses

2. **Does model capture soil moisture as mediator of CO₂ effect**?
   - CO₂ → increased moisture → increased microbial immobilization
   - Irrigation should produce similar effects to CO₂
   - Test: Comparable responses between Ct and ct-i treatments?

3. **Can model simulate temperature vs moisture tradeoff in warming**?
   - Warming → increased temperature (stimulates mineralization)
   - Warming → decreased moisture (inhibits mineralization)
   - Net result: Temperature effect dominates
   - Critical for predicting semiarid ecosystem responses

4. **Does model predict additive effects (no CO₂ × warming interactions)**?
   - Test across all N pools and fluxes
   - Compare to Hovenden et al. (2008) where interactions occurred
   - What ecosystem differences lead to additive vs interactive?

5. **Can model capture temporal dynamics**?
   - Seasonal patterns (strong summer effects, weak spring effects)
   - Development over time (root biomass increase in year 3)
   - Delayed responses (warming effects stronger in 2008 than 2007)

6. **Does model reproduce microbial vs plant partitioning**?
   - 186% increase in microbial NO₃⁻ uptake under CO₂
   - No change in plant NO₃⁻ uptake under CO₂
   - Critical for predicting PNL development

7. **Long-term predictions**:
   - Will microbial immobilization eventually limit plant growth?
   - Or will increased mineralization develop (as in Dijkstra et al. 2008)?
   - Test sensitivity to assumptions about N cycle feedbacks

## Comparison to Other Papers

### Comparison to Ma et al. 2011 (Chinese Grassland, W×N)

| Feature | Dijkstra et al. 2010 | Ma et al. 2011 |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Ecosystem** | Semiarid northern mixed-grass prairie | Temperate continental grassland |
| **Location** | Wyoming, USA | Jilin, China |

### Comparison to Larsen et al. 2011 (CLIMAITE, CO₂×T×D)

| Feature | Dijkstra et al. 2010 | Larsen et al. 2011 |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Ecosystem** | Semiarid grassland | Temperate heathland |
| **Precipitation** | 384 mm | 613 mm |
| **Soil pH** | 7.9 (alkaline) | 4-5 (acidic) |
| **Vegetation** | C₃ + C₄ grasses | Calluna + Deschampsia + mosses |
| **Treatments** | CO₂ × Warming | CO₂ × Warming × Drought |
| **Warming method** | Infrared continuous | Passive nighttime curtains |
| **CO₂ method** | FACE (continuous daytime) | FACE (daytime) |
| **Soil moisture** | CO₂ ↑, Warming ↓ | CO₂ ↑, Warming ↓, Drought ↓ |
| **N cycle CO₂** | More closed (↓ inorganic N) | More closed (↓ leaching, ↑ microbial) |
| **N cycle Warming** | More open (↑ inorganic N) | More open (↑ all N processes) |
| **Interactions** | None (additive) | Common (mostly antagonistic) |
| **Mechanism CO₂** | Microbial immobilization | Multiple, species-specific |
| **Mechanism Warming** | Direct temperature > moisture | Temperature stimulation of all processes |

**Key differences**:
- Dijkstra: Water-limited, alkaline, simple vegetation
- Larsen: Wetter, acidic, complex vegetation with multiple species
- Dijkstra: Clean additive effects
- Larsen: Frequent antagonistic interactions
- Both show: CO₂ → closed N cycle, Warming → open N cycle

### Comparison to Andresen et al. 2010 (CLIMAITE, CO₂×T×D)

Same site as Larsen, but different measurements:
- Andresen: Buried bag incubations, species-specific
- Dijkstra: ¹⁵N tracer, microbial vs plant partitioning
- Complementary approaches to N cycling

### Unique Contributions to Meta-Analysis

1. **Semiarid ecosystem focus**:
   - Water-limited (different from most warming/CO₂ studies)
   - Alkaline soil (pH 7.9, contrasts with acidic heathlands)
   - C₃ + C₄ grass mixture

2. **Clean CO₂ × warming factorial**:
   - FACE + infrared heaters
   - Tests additive vs interactive effects
   - One of few grassland studies with both factors

3. **Mechanistic ¹⁵N tracer study**:
   - Quantifies microbial vs plant NO₃⁻ uptake separately
   - Shows CO₂ effect mediated by microbial immobilization
   - Warming doesn't affect microbial uptake

4. **Soil moisture as key mediator**:
   - Continuous monitoring (hourly, 3+ years)
   - Irrigation treatment tests moisture hypothesis
   - CO₂ + irrigation produce similar effects

5. **Contrasting effects**:
   - CO₂ → closed N cycle (opposite of prediction)
   - Warming → open N cycle (as predicted)
   - Important for understanding combined climate change

6. **Model-experiment integration**:
   - DAYCENT predictions made BEFORE experiment
   - Tests specific hypotheses
   - Some predictions confirmed, some contradicted

7. **No interactions found**:
   - Additive effects across all variables
   - Contrasts with Larsen (many interactions)
   - Contrasts with Hovenden et al. 2008 (CO₂×T interaction)
   - Important for testing when interactions occur vs not

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths:
- **Factorial design** (2×2 CO₂ × warming)
- **Good replication** (n=5 per treatment)
- **Multiple measurement types** (pools, fluxes, integrative)
- **Mechanistic tracer study** (¹⁵N partitioning)
- **Continuous environmental monitoring** (hourly soil moisture, temperature)
- **Multi-year data** (3 years, 2006-2008)
- **Irrigation control** (tests soil moisture hypothesis)
- **FACE technology** (realistic CO₂ exposure)
- **Replicated harvest grid** (reduces spatial variability)

### Limitations:

**Temporal**:
- **Short duration** (3 years total, 2 years of warming)
  - Early transient responses may not persist
  - PNL may develop with longer exposure
- **Single ¹⁵N tracer study** (June 2007 only)
  - Only 2.5 months after warming started
  - May have missed warming effects on microbial uptake
  - Seasonal variation not captured
- **Few soil N sampling dates** (August 2007, April 2008, August 2008)
  - Misses detailed seasonal dynamics

**Spatial**:
- **Single site** (no geographic replication)
- **Small plot size** (3.4 m diameter)
  - Edge effects possible
  - Limited spatial heterogeneity
- **Two soil series** (Ascalon north, Altvan south with gravel layer)
  - Adds variability but included as random effect

**Methodological**:
- **¹⁵N tracer concerns**:
  - Only NO₃⁻ traced (not NH₄⁺)
  - NH₄⁺ avoided due to ammonia volatilization concerns (pH 7.9)
  - 48-hour harvest may be too soon for full uptake dynamics
  - Short-term (doesn't capture long-term fates)
  - Injection increased soil moisture by 1.9% (may affect uptake)
- **Root biomass uncertainty**:
  - High spatial heterogeneity
  - Hand-picking may miss fine roots
  - No root length density measured (can't confirm increased exploration)
- **Microbial biomass**:
  - Fumigation-extraction (standard but has limitations)
  - 0.54 conversion factor (literature value, may vary)
  - No microbial community composition (cf. Ma et al. PLFAs)
- **PRS probes**:
  - Provide index, not absolute N availability
  - July 2008 probes failed (soil too dry - poor contact)
  - Spatial variability (4 pairs per plot mitigates this)

**Treatment-specific**:
- **2006 irrigation**:
  - All plots irrigated 8× (160 mm) for establishment
  - Affects interpretation of 2006 data
  - Year 1 not representative of treatments
- **Warming timing**:
  - Started April 2007 (1 year after CO₂)
  - Limits ability to assess CO₂×warming interactions in 2006-2007
- **Passive warming variability**:
  - Depends on weather (clear sky, low wind)
  - Achieved warming varies (2.45°C at 3 cm, 1.81°C at 10 cm)
- **Plot division**:
  - Half for invasive species, half for native
  - Steel flange only to 25 cm (may not fully separate)

**Analysis**:
- **Statistical power**:
  - n=5 may limit detection of small effects or interactions
  - Some effects marginal (P=0.06-0.09)
- **No gaseous N losses measured**:
  - N₂O not quantified
  - Denitrification losses unknown
  - Complete N budget not possible
- **No litter decomposition**:
  - Can't assess decomposition changes
  - Important for long-term N cycling

### Uncertainty Sources:
- Spatial heterogeneity (roots especially)
- Temporal variability (few sampling dates)
- Treatment effect development (early in warming treatment)
- ¹⁵N tracer timing and duration
- Microbial biomass conversion factors
- Root exploration vs biomass increase

## Relevance to Warming/Nitrogen Meta-Analysis

**High relevance**:

1. **Clean factorial CO₂ × warming design**:
   - Separates main effects and interactions
   - Tests additive vs interactive hypotheses
   - Rare in grassland literature

2. **Semiarid ecosystem**:
   - Underrepresented in climate change literature
   - Water limitation key constraint
   - Different dynamics than mesic systems
   - Important for global coverage

3. **Contrasting CO₂ vs warming effects**:
   - CO₂ → closed N cycle (decreased inorganic N)
   - Warming → open N cycle (increased inorganic N)
   - Opposite effects important for combined change scenario

4. **Mechanistic understanding**:
   - ¹⁵N tracer partitions microbial vs plant uptake
   - Soil moisture identified as key mediator (CO₂ effect)
   - Temperature > moisture for warming effect

5. **No interactions**:
   - Additive effects across all variables
   - Contrasts with other studies (Larsen, Hovenden)
   - Important for testing when interactions occur

6. **Model-experiment comparison**:
   - Tests DAYCENT predictions
   - Some confirmed, some contradicted
   - Useful for model evaluation and improvement

**Unique contributions to meta-analysis**:

1. **Microbial immobilization as CO₂ mechanism**:
   - Quantified with ¹⁵N tracer (+186%)
   - Explains decreased soil inorganic N
   - Differs from plant uptake mechanism

2. **Soil moisture mediation**:
   - Continuous monitoring documents changes
   - Irrigation treatment tests hypothesis
   - Critical for predicting responses in water-limited systems

3. **Additive effects framework**:
   - Can compare to studies with interactions
   - Test ecosystem/treatment characteristics that lead to additivity vs interactions

4. **Alkaline semiarid grassland**:
   - Complements acidic heathlands (Larsen, Andresen)
   - Complements alkaline but wetter grasslands (Ma)
   - Expands pH × moisture space

5. **C₃ + C₄ grass mixture**:
   - Different from C₃-only (heathlands) or C₃-dominated (Ma)
   - Functional type diversity

6. **Short-term microbial response**:
   - Fast increase in microbial immobilization (1-2 years)
   - Contrasts with longer-term plant adjustments
   - Important for trajectory predictions

## Notes

- **Novel approach**: Model predictions (DAYCENT) made BEFORE field experiment
- **Key surprise**: CO₂ DECREASED soil inorganic N (predicted increase based on moisture)
- **Microbial dominance**: 186% increase in microbial NO₃⁻ uptake under CO₂ (largest effect size in study)
- **Temperature vs moisture**: Direct temperature effect > indirect moisture effect for warming
- **Additive paradigm**: No interactions suggest simpler combined response than expected
- **Water limitation**: Critical context for all responses in semiarid systems
- **PNL implications**: Microbial immobilization could lead to progressive N limitation
- **Long-term uncertainty**: Will microbial immobilization persist or will mineralization increase?
- **Seasonal gaps**: Spring responses less clear than summer (need more data)
- **Comparison value**: Clean factorial design ideal for testing model predictions
- **Irrigation insight**: ct-i treatment confirms soil moisture mechanism for CO₂
- **Root exploration hypothesis**: Increased root biomass under CO₂ may explain maintained plant N uptake (but needs root length data)
