## Study Overview
This is the **initial 6-month report** from the iconic Harvard Forest soil warming experiment. This same experiment was later reported by Butler et al. (2012) with 7 years of data, making these two papers a complete timeline of one of the longest-running soil warming experiments in temperate forests.

### Research Question
How do belowground processes in a mixed deciduous forest respond to elevated soil temperatures, with emphasis on:
1. Trace gas fluxes (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O)
2. Nitrogen availability and cycling
3. Temperature-dependent soil processes
4. Potential feedbacks to global climate change

### Key Innovation
- First systematic soil warming experiment in a temperate hardwood forest
- Comprehensive measurement of trace gases and N cycling together
- Direct test of global warming effects on belowground processes
- Rigorous experimental design with disturbance controls
- Achieved soil temperatures beyond natural range at Harvard Forest

- **Experimental design**: Randomized complete block design
- **Blocks**: 6
- **Plots per block**: 3 (one per treatment)
- **Sampling area**: 5 × 5 m nested within each 6 × 6 m plot (to avoid edge effects where heating was suboptimal)

- Compares each heated plot to average of undisturbed controls
- If temperature difference < 5°C: power ON
- If temperature difference ≥ 5°C: power OFF
- Individual plot control (independent relay circuits)

**Note**: This heating method was previously evaluated and performs well under various moisture and temperature conditions (Peterjohn et al. 1993).

### Timeline

- **Sampling frequency**: Twice monthly (9 plots in first half, 9 plots in second half of each month)
- **Each plot sampled**: Once per month

## Measurements

### Variables Measured
**Soil physical properties**:
- Soil temperature (2 and 4 cm depth, 4× daily during trace gas measurements)
- Soil moisture (gravimetric, forest floor and mineral soil)

**Nitrogen cycling**:
- Net N mineralization (buried bag technique, 22-36 d incubations)
- Net nitrification
- Extractable NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ (2 mol/L KCl, 48 h extraction)
- Lysimeter N (NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ at 50 cm depth)

**Trace gases**:
- CO₂ efflux (static chambers, 4 times daily: 0600, 1000, 1400, 1800 h)
- CH₄ uptake
- N₂O flux

### Methods

**Buried bag technique**:
- Two soil cores per plot (6 cm diameter × 13 cm deep)
- Initial cores: extracted with KCl, measured for gravimetric moisture
- Adjacent cores: incubated in situ in polyethylene bags for 22-36 d
- Net change in NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ calculated
- Analyzed by continuous flow colorimetry (Technicon Methods)
- Holes filled with external soil and marked to avoid resampling

**Trace gas measurements**:
- Static chambers placed over soil surface
- 30-minute deployment
- Headspace sampled at 10-minute intervals (0, 10, 20, 30 min)
- Gas chromatography analysis
- Net flux calculated from concentration changes
- One chamber per plot (fixed locations throughout experiment)
- Four daily measurements to capture diurnal variation

**Lysimeter measurements**:
- Porous cup lysimeters at 50 cm depth (below rooting zone)
- One lysimeter per plot
- Evacuated to 50 cm Hg
- Sampled 24 h after evacuation
- Twice monthly collection
- Samples frozen until analysis
- NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ analysis
- Detection limit: 0.1 mg N/L

### Statistical Approach
**Pretreatment analysis (June 1991)**:
- Two-way ANOVA (randomized complete block design)
- Scheffé pairwise comparison of means
- Friedman nonparametric two-way ANOVA
- Each sampling date analyzed separately
- Confirmed absence of preexisting differences

**Post-heating analysis (July-November 1991)**:
- Daily average values paired spatially (by blocks) and temporally (by sampling date)
- Paired t-tests for three effect types:
  1. **Heating effect**: H vs. DC (effect of warming alone)
  2. **Disturbance effect**: DC vs. C (effect of cable installation)
  3. **Heating + disturbance effect**: H vs. C (total effect)
- Sign test as nonparametric alternative
- Significance level: α = 0.05

**Rationale for statistical approach**:
- Heteroscedasticity detected (mean-variance correlation)
- Non-normal distributions (Wilk-Shapiro test, rankit plots)
- Both parametric and nonparametric tests applied

## Results

### Pretreatment Verification
**One exception noted**:
- Soil temperatures at 4 cm were ~2°C cooler in plots assigned to heating treatment
- Significant for only one sampling date
- Significant only for parametric test
- All other variables showed no preexisting differences

**Interpretation**: No systematic bias; random variation acceptable.

### Soil Temperature
**Heating success**:
- Target: +5°C above ambient
- Achievement: Successfully maintained +5°C elevation (Fig. 2 in paper)
- No disturbance effect detected (DC = C)

**Monthly average temperatures in heated plots**:
- July: ~20°C
- August: ~24°C
- September: ~22°C
- October: ~17°C
- November: ~9°C

**Context**: Heating achieved soil temperatures higher than any measured at Harvard Forest during previous 3 years (extended the temperature range beyond natural variability).

### Soil Moisture

**Forest floor**:
- No significant heating effect
- No significant disturbance effect
- Mean values: ~100-180% dry mass (highly variable)

**Mineral soil**:
- **Significant heating effect**: Warming reduced soil moisture
- No significant disturbance effect
- Strong inverse relationship with soil temperature (R² = 0.55 with one outlier removed)

**Interpretation**: Warmer soil → increased evaporation → drier soil (confounding factor for some responses).

### Nitrogen Availability

**Ammonium (NH₄⁺) concentrations**:
- Heating: consistently elevated monthly averages (both soil layers)
- Statistical significance: Not significant for daily averages
- Disturbance: also tended to elevate monthly averages
- Statistical significance: Not significant for daily averages
- **Heating + disturbance**: Significantly elevated NH₄⁺ in both layers

**Nitrate (NO₃⁻)**:
- No significant effects in any treatment
- Very little extractable NO₃⁻ throughout the study
- Little to no net nitrification detected

**Interpretation**: Forest is NH₄⁺-dominated system; nitrification minimal.

### Net Nitrogen Mineralization

**Forest floor**:
- **Control plots**: 1.20 mg N · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹
- **Heated plots**: 2.47 mg N · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹
- **Effect**: +106% increase (more than doubled)
- **Statistical significance**: P < 0.05 (heating effect significant)

**Mineral soil**:
- **Control plots**: 0.09 mg N · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹
- **Heated plots**: 0.19 mg N · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹
- **Effect**: +111% increase (more than doubled)
- **Statistical significance**: P < 0.05 (heating effect significant)

**Disturbance effect**: Not significant in either layer

**Key finding**: Heating doubled net N mineralization in both soil layers—a dramatic and consistent response.

### Soil Water Chemistry (Lysimeters at 50 cm)

**Sample collection**: August-November 1991 (158 total samples)

**Nitrate detection**:
- Only 3 samples with measurable NO₃⁻ (0.18-0.57 mg N/L)
- No apparent treatment effects

**Ammonium detection**:
- Only 14 samples with measurable NH₄⁺ (0.10-2.0 mg N/L)
- No apparent treatment effects

**Interpretation**:
- Very low inorganic N in deep soil water
- No N leaching losses detected
- No N saturation symptoms in first 6 months
- Closed N cycle maintained

### Carbon Dioxide Flux

**Heating effect**:
- Heating significantly increased CO₂ flux
- Disturbance also significantly increased CO₂ flux
- **Heating effect ~3× greater than disturbance effect**

**Monthly patterns** (daily average CO₂-C flux, mg·m⁻²·h⁻¹):
- July-August: Peak fluxes (200-300 in H plots, 150-200 in C plots)
- September-October: Declining (150-200 in H plots, 100-150 in C plots)
- November: Lowest (50-100 in both)

### Temperature-CO₂ Relationship

**Exponential relationship**:
- Daily CO₂ efflux increased exponentially with soil temperature
- Linear regression: ln(CO₂ flux) vs. temperature
- **R² = 0.92** (92% of variability explained)
- Relationship consistent with Arrhenius equation

**Arrhenius parameters**:
- **Q₁₀ = 2.5** (flux increases 2.5× per 10°C increase)
- **Activation energy (Ea) = 63 kJ/mol**
- Note: 63 kJ/mol is slightly higher than typical enzyme catalysis range (20.9-62.8 kJ/mol)

### Soil Moisture-CO₂ Relationship
- CO₂ flux decreased linearly with increasing soil moisture
- R² = 0.44 (44% of variability explained, with one outlier removed)
- Temperature is a much stronger predictor than moisture

**Multiple regression**:
- Temperature + moisture together: R² = 0.94
- Soil moisture significantly improved predictions beyond temperature alone

### Annual CO₂ Flux Prediction

**Prediction method**:
1. Measured relationship: air temperature ↔ soil temperature (R² = 0.90)
2. Measured relationship: soil temperature ↔ CO₂ flux (R² = 0.92)
3. Applied 1991 air temperature data from Harvard Forest weather station

**Predicted annual CO₂-C fluxes for 1991**:
- **Unheated soil**: 712 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹
- **Heated soil (+5°C)**: 1250 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹
- **Additional carbon release from warming**: 538 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ (76% increase)

**Validation**:
- Actual measurements agreed closely with predictions
- Unheated: R² = 0.885
- Heated: R² = 0.823

**Mechanism**: Increased release could be from:
1. Enhanced microbial decomposition
2. Increased root respiration
3. Combination of both

**Global context**:
- If representative of all 3.6 × 10¹² m² of temperate deciduous forest
- A 5°C global soil temperature increase would release an additional 1.9 × 10¹⁵ g C/yr as CO₂
- Major potential feedback to climate warming

**Important caveats**:
1. May only represent short-lived depletion of labile C pool
2. Enhanced soil respiration may be offset by enhanced plant productivity
3. Experiment "decoupled" below- and aboveground processes
4. Cannot determine whole-ecosystem C balance
5. Increased N availability might increase NPP faster than respiration

### Comparison to Other Hardwood Forests
The exponential temperature-CO₂ relationship from Harvard Forest is **consistent with data from other hardwood forests worldwide**:
- Minnesota (Reiners 1968)
- Tennessee (Edwards 1975)
- Missouri (Garrett and Cox 1973)
- United Kingdom (Anderson 1973)
- Italy (Virzo De Santo et al. 1976)
- Japan (Nakane 1980)

**Implication**: The response observed at Harvard Forest appears generalizable to temperate hardwood forests globally.

### Methane Uptake

**Heating effect**:
- Heating significantly elevated CH₄ uptake
- **Disturbance effect**: Not significant

**Linear relationships**:
- CH₄ uptake increased linearly with increasing soil temperature (R² = 0.46)
- CH₄ uptake decreased linearly with increasing soil moisture (R² = 0.49, one outlier removed)
- No logarithmic transformation improved relationships

**Multiple regression**:
- Temperature + moisture: R² = 0.61
- Soil moisture did not significantly improve predictions (P = 0.0994, nearly significant)
- Moisture effect may have been weakened by missing data (7 cases removed)

**Monthly patterns**:
- Generally 0.09-0.16 mg C·m⁻²·h⁻¹ range
- Heated plots consistently higher than controls

**Unexpected finding**: CH₄ uptake **increased** rather than decreased with warming.
- Contradicts N saturation expectation (high N should decrease CH₄ uptake)
- No evidence of N saturation in first 6 months

### Nitrous Oxide Flux

**Results**:
- Low flux in all treatments (~-4 to +8 μg N·m⁻²·h⁻¹, mostly near zero)
- Relatively constant over time
- **No significant heating effect**
- **No significant disturbance effect**

**Relationships with environmental variables**:
- Weak relationship with soil temperature (R² = 0.14)
- Weak relationship with soil moisture (R² = 0.23, one outlier removed)
- Multiple regression: R² = 0.28 (did not significantly improve predictions)

**Explanation**: Absence of nitrate and net nitrification likely accounts for low N₂O flux.

## Major Findings

### 1. Soil Respiration Response
**Large and immediate increase in CO₂ efflux**:
- Exponential relationship with temperature (Q₁₀ = 2.5)
- Consistent with Arrhenius kinetics (Ea = 63 kJ/mol)
- Warming (+5°C) would release additional 538 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹
- 76% increase in annual soil CO₂ flux

### 2. Nitrogen Mineralization Response
**Doubled net N mineralization**:
- Forest floor: 1.20 → 2.47 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ (+106%)
- Mineral soil: 0.09 → 0.19 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ (+111%)
- Statistically significant and consistent across both layers
- Suggests enhanced decomposition and N cycling

### 3. No Nitrogen Saturation in First 6 Months
**Expected symptoms NOT observed**:
- No increase in net nitrification (remained minimal)
- No increase in N₂O flux (remained low)
- No increase in soil water inorganic N (remained near detection limit)
- CH₄ uptake increased (opposite of N saturation effect)

**Interpretation**: System is responding, but N saturation has not developed in short term.

### 4. Closed Nitrogen Cycle Maintained
- Very low soil water N concentrations
- No apparent N leaching losses
- N retained in forest floor and mineral soil
- Tight plant-microbial-soil N cycling

### 5. Methane Uptake Increased
- Unexpected finding (contrary to N saturation hypothesis)
- Increased linearly with temperature
- Suggests methanotroph activity enhanced by warming

### 6. Temperature is Primary Driver
- Temperature explained 92% of CO₂ flux variability
- Soil moisture had secondary role (added 2% in multiple regression)
- Linear temperature relationships for CH₄ uptake
- Weak relationships for N₂O flux

### 7. Disturbance Effects
- Significant for CO₂ flux (but 1/3 magnitude of heating effect)
- Not significant for N mineralization, CH₄ uptake, N₂O flux, or soil moisture
- Justifies inclusion of disturbance controls

### 8. Consistent with Global Data
- Temperature-CO₂ relationship matches other hardwood forests worldwide
- Suggests findings may be broadly applicable to temperate deciduous forests

## Comparison to Butler et al. 2012 (Same Experiment, 7 Years Later)

### Timeline Connection
- **Peterjohn et al. 1994**: First 6 months (July-November 1991)
- **Butler et al. 2012**: Years 1-7 (1991-1998)
- Same experimental site, plots, and warming treatment

### Short-term vs. Long-term Responses

**Net N mineralization**:
- **Peterjohn (6 months)**: Doubled in both layers (+106-111%)
- **Butler (7 years)**: +45% sustained increase in forest floor
- **Pattern**: Initial spike, then partial acclimation or depletion of labile pool

**Nitrification**:
- **Peterjohn (6 months)**: Little to no net nitrification detected
- **Butler (7 years)**: 3× increase by year 5; 25% of mineralized N → NO₃⁻ by year 7
- **Pattern**: Delayed response; nitrification developed over years

**Nitrogen leaching**:
- **Peterjohn (6 months)**: No N in lysimeters (closed cycle)
- **Butler (7 years)**: Closed N cycle maintained (no losses detected)
- **Pattern**: Tight retention even with long-term warming

**CO₂ flux**:
- **Peterjohn (6 months)**: +538 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ (76% increase predicted)
- **Butler (7 years)**: Not the primary focus, but sustained elevated respiration implied
- **Pattern**: Likely some acclimation over time

### Ecological Interpretation
1. **Initial responses are rapid**: N mineralization and CO₂ flux responded immediately
2. **Some acclimation occurs**: Mineralization increase moderated from +106% to +45%
3. **Nitrification is a delayed response**: Took years to develop significantly
4. **Closed cycle is robust**: No N losses even after 7 years
5. **Labile C pools**: May have been partially depleted in first 6 months

### What Peterjohn Missed (That Butler Captured)
- **Plant responses**: Species-specific growth and N uptake (Butler showed red maple doubled RGR)
- **Long-term nitrification**: 3× increase took 5 years to develop
- **Acclimation patterns**: Moderation of initial large responses
- **Interannual variability**: Year-to-year patterns in responses
- **Ecosystem-level N retention**: Demonstrated over years, not just months

### What Peterjohn Established
- **Proof of concept**: Heating system worked effectively
- **Immediate responses**: Demonstrated rapid temperature sensitivity
- **Arrhenius parameters**: Q₁₀ and activation energy for temperate forest
- **No artifacts**: Disturbance controls showed minimal confounding
- **Baseline data**: Established pre-acclimation response magnitudes

## Relevance to EcoSIM Modeling

### Direct Parameterization Opportunities

**1. Temperature sensitivity of decomposition**:
- **Q₁₀ = 2.5** for soil respiration
- **Activation energy = 63 kJ/mol**
- Can be directly implemented in EcoSIM's temperature functions
- Arrhenius equation confirmed for temperate hardwood forest

**2. N mineralization response**:
- **Doubling with +5°C** in first 6 months
- Separate responses for forest floor vs. mineral soil
- Initial response magnitude before acclimation
- Can calibrate EcoSIM's temperature-dependent mineralization

**3. Moisture-respiration interaction**:
- Inverse linear relationship (R² = 0.44)
- Combined temperature-moisture model (R² = 0.94)
- Can calibrate EcoSIM's moisture limitation functions

**4. CH₄ oxidation**:
- Positive linear relationship with temperature
- Uptake rates: 0.09-0.16 mg C·m⁻²·h⁻¹
- Can parameterize methanotroph activity in EcoSIM

**5. Minimal nitrification**:
- NH₄⁺-dominated system
- Very low NO₃⁻ production in first 6 months
- Helps calibrate nitrifier populations and activity

### Model Testing Opportunities

**1. Short-term vs. long-term responses**:
- Test whether EcoSIM predicts acclimation (compare to Butler et al. 2012)
- Does model show initial spike in mineralization followed by moderation?
- Does model develop nitrification over time?

**2. Labile vs. recalcitrant C pools**:
- Large initial C flux (538 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ increase)
- Test whether EcoSIM's C pools deplete realistically
- Does model predict sustained vs. transient responses?

**3. Temperature-moisture interaction**:
- Warming reduced soil moisture (confounding factor)
- Test whether EcoSIM captures evaporation feedback
- Does model predict realistic moisture changes?

**4. Closed N cycle**:
- No N leaching despite doubled mineralization
- Test whether EcoSIM's plant-microbial competition prevents losses
- Does model maintain closed cycle under warming?

**5. Disturbance effects**:
- Small but significant CO₂ increase from cable installation
- Test whether EcoSIM's initialization handles disturbance
- Does model capture short-term disturbance response?

### Process Understanding Contributions

**1. Decoupling below- and aboveground**:
- Heating only soil (not air or canopy)
- Demonstrates direct soil process responses
- Useful for isolating soil sub-model behavior in EcoSIM

**2. Multiple soil layers**:
- Separate measurements for forest floor and mineral soil
- Tests EcoSIM's vertical structure
- Different response magnitudes in different layers

**3. Trace gas integration**:
- CO₂, CH₄, N₂O measured simultaneously
- Tests EcoSIM's coupled C and N cycling
- Captures both aerobic and anaerobic processes

**4. Time scales**:
- Daily diurnal measurements (4× per day for trace gases)
- Monthly patterns over growing season
- Annual predictions
- Tests EcoSIM across multiple temporal scales

### Limitations for Modeling

**1. Pseudoreplication**:
- Single large heated area per plot (6 × 6 m)
- Not true independent replicates for some processes
- Limits statistical power (same issue as Butler et al. 2012)

**2. Short duration**:
- Only 6 months of warming
- Initial "shock" responses may not represent steady state
- Need long-term data (Butler et al. 2012) for sustained behavior

**3. Soil warming only**:
- Air and canopy not warmed
- Decoupled plant-soil feedbacks
- Cannot validate whole-ecosystem C balance in EcoSIM

**4. No plant measurements**:
- Root respiration vs. microbial respiration not partitioned
- Plant N uptake not measured
- Cannot calibrate plant sub-models directly

**5. Confounding moisture effect**:
- Warming reduced soil moisture
- Difficult to isolate pure temperature effect
- Need to account for indirect moisture changes in model

**6. Missing mechanisms**:
- Root respiration vs. heterotrophic respiration not separated
- Microbial biomass not measured
- Enzyme activities not measured
- Limits mechanistic calibration of EcoSIM

### Complementary Studies Needed

**To fully parameterize EcoSIM**:
1. **Long-term data**: Butler et al. 2012 provides 7-year responses
2. **Plant responses**: Measure aboveground NPP, root growth, N uptake
3. **Microbial measurements**: Biomass, community composition, enzyme activities
4. **Respiration partitioning**: Trenching or isotope studies to separate root vs. microbial
5. **Whole-ecosystem warming**: Couple soil and air warming
6. **Multiple sites**: Test across soil types, forest types, climates

### Key Insights for Model Development

**1. Non-linear temperature responses**:
- Exponential (Arrhenius) is appropriate functional form
- Q₁₀ varies by process (2.5 for respiration, but linear for CH₄ uptake)
- EcoSIM should use process-specific temperature functions

**2. Rapid vs. slow processes**:
- CO₂ flux responded immediately (hours to days)
- N mineralization responded quickly (weeks)
- Nitrification responded slowly (years; from Butler et al. 2012)
- EcoSIM must capture different time scales

**3. Soil layer differences**:
- Forest floor and mineral soil had similar % increases but different absolute rates
- Layer-specific parameterization needed in EcoSIM

**4. Multiple limiting factors**:
- Temperature primary driver (R² = 0.92)
- Moisture secondary but important (added 2% to R²)
- EcoSIM should implement hierarchical limitations

**5. Initial transient responses**:
- Large initial spikes may reflect labile pool depletion
- Models need multiple C and N pools with different turnover rates
- EcoSIM's multi-pool structure is appropriate

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Limitations

**1. Short duration**:
- Only 6 months of warming
- Initial "shock" responses may not represent long-term patterns
- Cannot assess acclimation or steady-state responses
- Fortunately, Butler et al. (2012) provides long-term follow-up

**2. Confounding moisture effect**:
- Warming reduced soil moisture significantly
- Difficult to separate direct temperature effect from indirect moisture effect
- Multiple regression helps but doesn't fully resolve

**3. Soil warming only**:
- Air and canopy not warmed
- Decoupled below- and aboveground processes
- Cannot determine whole-ecosystem C balance
- Plant responses to warming not captured

**4. No mechanistic measurements**:
- Root vs. microbial respiration not partitioned
- Microbial biomass not measured
- Enzyme activities not measured
- Limits mechanistic understanding of responses

**5. Pseudoreplication concern**:
- Single large heated area per plot (6 × 6 m with nested 5 × 5 m sampling)
- Static chambers never moved (same location throughout)
- May underestimate spatial variability within plots

**6. Limited lysimeter data**:
- Only 4 months of soil water collection (August-November)
- Most samples below detection limit
- Cannot assess N leaching risk adequately in first 6 months

**7. Missing nitrification detail**:
- Very low NO₃⁻ throughout study
- Cannot characterize nitrification temperature sensitivity
- Need longer study (Butler et al. 2012 shows nitrification develops)

**8. No plant N uptake**:
- Cannot close N budget
- Cannot determine if enhanced mineralization increased plant N availability
- Plant-microbial competition not quantified

**9. Single site**:
- Harvard Forest only
- One soil type (Gloucester series)
- One forest type (mixed deciduous)
- Limited generalizability

**10. Statistical power**:
- Some effects "consistent but not significant" (e.g., monthly NH₄⁺ averages)
- May lack power to detect smaller effects
- 6 blocks × 3 treatments = adequate but not large n

### Data Quality Assessment

**High quality**:
- Trace gas measurements (replicated, diurnal coverage, automated)
- Soil temperature (continuous monitoring, 42 thermistors)
- N mineralization (standard buried bag technique)

**Moderate quality**:
- Soil moisture (adequate but confounded with temperature)
- Extractable N (high variability, some effects not significant)
- Lysimeter N (many samples below detection, limited temporal coverage)

**Missing**:
- Microbial data
- Root data
- Plant data
- Respiration partitioning

### Comparability to Other Studies

**Similar methods to**:
- Butler et al. 2012 (same experiment, extended duration)
- Van Cleve et al. 1990 (Alaskan black spruce warming)

   - Findings may be broadly applicable

### Uncertainties Acknowledged

1. **Short-term vs. long-term**:
   - Observed responses may represent depletion of labile C pool
   - Long-term monitoring needed to assess sustained patterns

2. **Whole-ecosystem balance unclear**:
   - Soil respiration increased, but net ecosystem C balance unknown
   - Enhanced N availability might increase NPP faster than respiration
   - Could shift ecosystem from C source to C sink

3. **Decoupled processes**:
   - Warming only soil (not air or plants)
   - Cannot determine how global warming would affect full ecosystem interactions

4. **Mechanism uncertainty**:
   - Enhanced respiration could be microbial, root, or both
   - Need partitioning studies to understand mechanisms

### Forward Looking

Authors note that **long-term field measurements are needed** to:
1. Determine if responses are sustained or transient
2. Assess whole-ecosystem C balance
3. Understand plant-soil feedbacks
4. Test predictions of ecosystem models

**This call was answered by Butler et al. (2012)**, who continued measurements for 7 additional years at the same site.

### Response Summary

| Variable | Control | Heated | Change | Significance |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Net N mineralization (forest floor) | 1.20 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ | 2.47 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ | +106% | P < 0.05 |
| Net N mineralization (mineral soil) | 0.09 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ | 0.19 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ | +111% | P < 0.05 |
| Annual CO₂-C flux (predicted) | 712 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | 1250 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | +538 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ (+76%) | Significant |
| CH₄ uptake | Lower | Higher | Increase | P < 0.05 |
| N₂O flux | Low | Low | No change | NS |
| Nitrification | Minimal | Minimal | No change | NS |
| Soil water N | <0.1 mg/L | <0.1 mg/L | No change | NS |

### Key Parameter Values
- **Q₁₀** for soil respiration: **2.5**
- **Activation energy (Ea)**: **63 kJ/mol**
- **Temperature-CO₂ R²**: **0.92**
- **Temperature + moisture CO₂ R²**: **0.94**

### Major Conclusions
1. Soil warming immediately increased CO₂ efflux (exponential, Arrhenius)
2. Doubled net N mineralization in first 6 months
3. No N saturation symptoms detected
4. Closed N cycle maintained (no leaching)
5. CH₄ uptake increased (unexpected)
6. Temperature > moisture as driver of respiration

### Study Limitations
- Short duration (6 months only)
- Soil warming only (decoupled from plants)
- Confounding moisture effect
- No mechanistic measurements
- Single site

### Follow-up Study
**Butler et al. (2012)** continued this experiment for 7 years, showing:
- Sustained +45% mineralization increase (moderated from initial +106%)
- Delayed nitrification response (3× increase by year 5)
- Species-specific plant responses
- Closed N cycle maintained long-term
