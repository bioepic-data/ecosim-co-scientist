## Significance

This study represents the **FIRST experimental investigation of combined warming and grazing effects** on the rangelands of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, one of the world's most extensive grazing systems (2.5×10⁶ km²). The findings challenge conventional wisdom in multiple ways:

1. **Warming DECREASED productivity** - a rare finding that contradicts results from most tundra warming experiments, which typically show increased or no change in ANPP
2. **Grazing INCREASED productivity** - directly contradicts the prevailing view in China that overgrazing by pastoralists is degrading Tibetan rangelands and driving policy decisions
3. **Non-additive combined effects** - demonstrates that single-factor climate change studies cannot predict ecosystem responses to multiple simultaneous global changes
4. **Grazing can mitigate warming effects** - synergistic interactions showed that grazing dampened warming-induced productivity declines
5. **Asian monsoon climate creates unique responses** - vegetation responses differed from Rocky Mountain alpine systems, cautioning against biome-level extrapolations

The study has profound implications for:
- **6 billion people** living on or downstream of the Tibetan Plateau
- **Tibetan pastoralists** whose subsistence depends on rangeland quality
- **Grassland policy** including the controversial policy eliminating grazing from degraded rangelands
- **Climate-vegetation feedbacks** in the 35% of the Tibetan Plateau covered by alpine meadow and shrub vegetation
- **Understanding the climate warming vs. land use debate** regarding vegetation changes on the Plateau

## Study Site Description

### Location
- **Site:** Haibei Alpine Research Station (HARS)
- **Coordinates:** 37°37'N, 101°12'E
- **Elevation:** 3200m (valley bottom)
- **Region:** Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai Province, China

### Climate
- **Mean annual temperature:** -2°C
- **Mean annual precipitation:** 600 mm
- **Precipitation seasonality:** >80% falls during summer monsoon growing season
- **Winter:** Typically dry with occasional snowfall that melts quickly due to high solar radiation
- **Growing season:** Approximately May through October

This **Asian monsoon climate pattern** is fundamentally different from Rocky Mountain alpine systems (where >80% precipitation falls as winter snow), creating unique ecosystem dynamics.

### Habitats and Vegetation

**Two main habitat types:**

1. **Winter-grazed meadows** (valley floor)
   - Dominated by assemblage of forbs and graminoids
   - Total ANPP: 316 g/m²/yr (excluding woody biomass)
   - Peak standing biomass: 316 g/m²
   - Shrubs absent
   - Warmer and drier than shrublands

2. **Summer-grazed shrublands** (higher slopes)
   - Dominated by deciduous shrub *Potentilla fruticosa*
   - Total ANPP: 226 g/m²/yr (excluding woody shrub growth)
   - Peak standing biomass: 852 g/m² (including woody biomass)
   - Mixed shrub-graminoid-forb community

**General vegetation characteristics:**
- **Species richness:** Average 30 plant species per 75×75 cm plot
- **Life forms:** Mostly C₃ perennial plants
- **Extent:** Alpine meadow and shrub vegetation comprise ~35% of Tibetan Plateau area

**Important indicator species:**
- *Gentiana straminea* - medicinal forb, brings supplemental income to pastoralists
- *Stellera chamaejasme* - poisonous, non-palatable forb
- *Oxytropis* spp. - non-palatable forb
- *Potentilla fruticosa* - deciduous shrub (shrublands only)
- *Stipa purpurea* - dominant grass
- *Kobresia humilis* - dominant sedge

### Soils
- **Meadows:** Mat-Cryic Cambisols
- **Shrublands:** Mollic-Cryic Cambisols

### Grazing History
All sites characterized by **long evolutionary history of grazing**. Within each habitat, sites varied in **recent (15-year) grazing intensity:**

- **High grazing (HG) history sites:** Higher intensity and duration in 15 years prior to study
- **Low grazing (LG) history sites:** Lower intensity and duration in 15 years prior to study

This design allowed evaluation of which results are robust despite differences in recent grazing history.

## Experimental Design

### Overview
- **Duration:** 1998-2001 (4 years of measurements)
- **Design:** Split-plot, repeated-measures factorial experiment
- **Factors:** Warming (OTC) × Clipping (simulated grazing)
- **Sites:** 4 total (2 habitats × 2 grazing histories)
- **Plots per site:** 16 (4 treatments × 4 replicates)
- **Total plots:** 64
- **Plot area:** 30×30 m fenced areas
- **Sampling area:** 75×75 cm centered in each plot

### Treatments

**1. Warming Treatment - Open-Top Chambers (OTCs)**
- **Installation:** September 1997
- **Design:** Conical chambers
  - Base diameter: 1.5 m
  - Top diameter: 0.75 m
  - Height: 0.40 m
- **Duration:** Year-round (not removed)
- **Method:** International Tundra Experiment standard design

**Temperature effects achieved:**
- Growing-season mean daily air temperature: **+1.0 to +2.0°C**
- Maximum daily air temperature: **+2.1 to +7.3°C**
- Diurnal air temperature range: **+1.9 to +6.5°C**
- Minimum daily air temperature: No effect
- Soil temperature (12 cm depth): **~+1.0°C early in growing season**, minimal effect later
- Soil moisture: Few effects

2. **Clipping Treatment - Simulated Grazing**
- **Initiation:** Spring 1998
- **Timing varied by habitat:**
  - **Meadows:** Early spring, prior to growth initiation (simulating winter grazing)
  - **Shrublands:** Mid-July (simulating summer grazing)
- **Height:** Clipped to ~3 cm
- **Intensity:**
  - Shrublands: Removed ~30% of total live peak AG biomass
  - Meadows: Removed ~15% of total live peak AG biomass
- **Selective:** Did not clip non-palatable plants (*Oxytropis* spp., *Stellera chamaejasme*)
- **Shrub treatment:** Plucked leaves and stem tips to simulate sheep browsing
- **Biomass accounting:** Clipped vegetation dried, weighed, added to clipped plot ANPP estimates

**Validation of clipping as grazing simulation:**
- Established 4 "grazing control" (GC) plots outside fenced areas in 2000
- Located 5-15 m from fence
- ANPP in clipped vs. grazed plots: Not significantly different (except forb ANPP in 2000: clipped 12 g/m² less, P=0.06)

**3. Treatment Combinations**
- **T(control):** No OTC, no clip
- **T(warm):** +OTC, no clip
- **T(clip):** No OTC, +clip
- **T(warm×clip):** +OTC, +clip

### Grazing History Factor
- **Within habitat replication:** Sites with different 15-year grazing histories
- **Nested design:** Grazing history nested within habitat
- **Purpose:** Evaluate robustness of results across grazing history variation
- **Trade-off:** More within-habitat variability than random site selection, but significant results should be robust

## Methods

### Aboveground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP)

**Non-destructive sampling method:**
- **Quadrat:** 75×75 cm divided into 400 squares (3.75×3.75 cm each)
- **Coverage estimate:** Within each square, recorded dominant (>50% coverage) plant group
- **Calibration:** Off-plot harvesting to construct coverage-biomass regression equations
- **Regression quality:** Average adjusted R²=0.96, average P=0.0005, poorest fit R²=0.91

**Plant groups measured:**
- Shrub (foliar only, not woody biomass)
- Forb (total)
- Graminoid (grass + sedge combined, or separate)

**Individual forb species measured (1999-2001):**
- *Morina chinensis*
- *Gentiana straminea*
- *Saussurea superba*
- *Aster flaccidus*
- *Polygonum viviparum*
- *Stellera chamaejasme* (non-palatable)

**Sampling frequency:** Once every 4 weeks throughout growing season (May-October), 1998-2001

**ANPP approximation:** Peak aboveground live biomass = good approximation
- All live AG biomass from current season's growth
- No new growth carry-over from previous year
- Standing dead/litter mostly from previous years
- Current-year death negligible

**Conservative estimates:**
- May slightly underestimate early-blooming forb ANPP
- Did not measure annual woody biomass increments (only shrub foliar production)
- Wood production doesn't directly contribute to forage, so not important omission

**Derived metrics:**
- **Total ANPP:** Sum of all plant group ANPP
- **Palatable ANPP:** Total ANPP minus non-palatable forb ANPP
- **Standing shrub biomass:** Foliar + woody biomass (2000-2001)

### Monthly Biomass Measurements

**Purpose:** Assess live biomass availability throughout growing season

**Method:** Same non-destructive sampling method as ANPP

**Frequency:** Monthly from May through October 2000

**Metrics:** Live aboveground biomass by plant group and total

### Forage Nutritive Quality - Direct Effects

**Objective:** Measure direct warming and clipping effects on foliar chemistry within plant groups

**Sample collection:**
- **Years:** 1998 and 2001
- **Timing:** August (full sun exposure, same maturity level)
- **Plots:** All 64 experimental plots
- **Tissue:** Leaf blades only

**Chemical analysis:**
- **Instrument:** Carlo Erba NC2100
- **Measurements:**
  - Percentage carbon (C)
  - Percentage nitrogen (N)
  - C:N ratio

**Interpretation:**
- **%N:** Related to crude protein content (higher = better quality)
- **C:N ratio:** Overall forage quality proxy (lower = better quality)
  - C represents fibrous components
  - N represents easily digestible protein

**Representative species per plant group:**
- **Forb:** *Gentiana straminea* (present at all sites)
- **Grass:** *Stipa purpurea* (most abundant)
- **Sedge:** *Kobresia humilis* (most abundant)
- **Shrub:** *Potentilla fruticosa* (only shrub species, shrublands only)

### Forage Nutritive Quality - Indirect Effects

**Objective:** Examine how treatment-induced shifts in plant group ANPP affect overall forage quality

**Method:** Van Soest sequential detergent fiber analysis

**Sample collection:**
- **Year:** 2000
- **Timing:** August, peak standing biomass
- **Location:** Off-plot within each fenced site
- **Tissue:** Leaves of each plant group
- **Same representative species** as direct effects analysis

**Laboratory:** Wildlife Habitat and Nutrition Lab, Washington State University

**Measurements:**
- **NDF:** Neutral detergent fiber (%)
- **ADF:** Acid detergent fiber (%)
- **ADL:** Acid detergent lignin (%)
- **AIA:** Acid insoluble ash (%)

**Digestibility index calculated:**
- **DDM (%)** = 0.98S + (NDF)Dc - M
  - S = cell contents (average 98% digestibility)
  - Dc = cell wall digestion coefficient = 147.3 - 78.9 log₁₀([lignin/ADF]×100)
  - M = estimated fecal losses (standard 12.9 units)
- **Highly correlated with in vitro digestion studies**

**Rationale for not using on experimental plots:** Required more leaf tissue than willing to harvest from 64 experimental plots

### Root Biomass

**Method:** Soil cores

**Purpose:** Determine if ANPP treatment effects result from shifting above/belowground allocation

**Result:** Treatment effects on ANPP not due to allocation shifts (details in Appendix C)

### Statistical Analysis

**Design:** Split-plot, repeated-measures ANOVA

**Model structure:**
- **Whole plot:** Habitat (meadow vs. shrubland)
  - Grazing history nested within habitat
- **Split plot:** Individual plots within each site
- **Repeated measure:** Year (1998-2001)
- **Covariance structure:** First-order autoregressive

**Software:** SAS 9.1

**Interpretation of treatment effects:**

When **warm×clip interaction absent:**
- **Warm effect** = ([T(warm)+T(warm×clip)]/2) - ([T(control)+T(clip)]/2)
- **Clip effect** = ([T(clip)+T(warm×clip)]/2) - ([T(control)+T(warm)]/2)
- **Combined effect** = T(warm×clip) - T(control)
- **Strictly additive:** Combined = Warm(no clip) + Clip(no warm)

When **warm×clip interaction present:**
- **Warm(no clip)** = T(warm) - T(control)
- **Warm(+clip)** = T(warm×clip) - T(clip)
- **Clip(no warm)** = T(clip) - T(control)
- **Clip(+warm)** = T(warm×clip) - T(warm)
- **Combined effect** = Warm(no clip) + Clip(no warm) + interaction effect

**Significance:** P ≤ 0.05 (unless otherwise noted as P ≤ 0.1 for trends)

**Temporal patterns:** Most warming effects absent in 1998, significant in subsequent years

**Monthly biomass analysis (2000 only):**
- Same split-plot repeated-measures design
- Repeated measure: Month (not year)
- Data: Log-transformed to meet normality assumptions

## Major Findings

### I. Warming Effects on ANPP

**A. Total ANPP**

**Meadow habitats:**
- **Decreased by 40 g/m²/yr** (P<0.05)
- From ~275 g/m²/yr (no warm) to ~235 g/m²/yr (warm)
- **Consistent decline from 1999-2001**
- No effect in 1998 (first year)

**Shrubland habitats:**
- **No significant effect on total ANPP**
- Remained ~210-225 g/m²/yr
- Decrease in graminoids offset by increase in shrubs

**Mechanism for habitat difference:**
- Both habitats: Warming decreased graminoid ANPP
- Shrublands only: Warming increased shrub ANPP to compensate
- Meadows: No shrubs present to compensate

**B. Graminoid ANPP**

**Both habitats affected:**
- **Decreased by 36-50 g/m²/yr** (P<0.05)
- Effect size similar across habitats
- **Consistent from 1999-2001**

**Potential mechanisms:**
1. **At shrublands:** Negative correlation between shrub and grass ANPP (r=-0.7, n=114)
   - Suggests **interspecific competition** with warming-stimulated shrubs
   - Similar to Dunnett & Grime (1999) findings of competition-mediated responses

2. **At meadows:**
   - Soil moisture declines with warming (Klein et al. 2005)
     - Present at HG meadow (all warmed plots)
     - Present at LG meadow (warm+clip plots only)
   - High leaf temperatures
   - Extended growing season followed by sudden winter onset
   - Increased litter cover (Klein et al. 2004)

**C. Shrub Foliar ANPP (Shrublands Only)**

**Major increase:**
- **Increased by 20-25 g/m²/yr** (1999-2001) (P<0.05)
- Foliar production only (woody biomass not measured separately)

**Total standing biomass:**
- **Increased by 72 g/m² in 2000** (P=0.1)
- **Increased by 102 g/m² in 2001** (P<0.05)
- Includes woody biomass

**Consistency with other studies:**
- Similar shrub increases observed in:
  - Rocky Mountain alpine (Harte & Shaw 1995)
  - Arctic tundra (Hobbie & Chapin 1998, Arft et al. 1999)
  - Various tundra sites (Walker et al. 2006)
  - Fen/bog systems (Weltzin et al. 2000)
  - Sagebrush (Perfors et al. 2003)

**Implications:**
- **Rangeland quality decline:** Shrubs less digestible than graminoids
- **Herd composition shifts:** Sheep browse shrubs, but yak and horses do not
  - Potential shift from yak (basis of Tibetan culture) to sheep
  - Profound social, economic, political, ecological consequences
- **Carbon storage:** Shrub expansion affects ecosystem C storage
- **Energy balance:** Shrub expansion alters net energy balance

**D. Forb ANPP**

**Overall forb ANPP:**
- **No significant warming effect** when averaged across all forb species
- Due to **individualistic species responses**

**Species-specific responses varied by:**
1. Presence/absence of clipping
2. Time (more pronounced over years)
3. Species identity

**Key species responses:**

*Gentiana straminea* (medicinal forb):
- **Warm(no clip): DECREASED** from ~37 g/m²/yr to ~12 g/m²/yr (P<0.05)
- Warm(+clip): No effect (remained ~18-24 g/m²/yr)
- **Warm×clip interaction present**
- **Economic impact:** Important supplemental income source for pastoralists

*Stellera chamaejasme* (non-palatable, poisonous):
- **Warm: INCREASED** from ~2 g/m²/yr to ~4 g/m²/yr (P<0.05)
- Effect regardless of clipping presence/absence
- **Rangeland quality decline**

*Oxytropis* spp. (non-palatable):
- Warm(no clip): No effect (~2 g/m²/yr)
- **Warm(+clip): DECREASED** from ~14 g/m²/yr to ~2 g/m²/yr (P<0.05)
- **Warm×clip interaction present**

Other forbs measured:
- *Morina chinensis*
- *Saussurea superba*
- *Aster flaccidus*
- *Polygonum viviparum*

**Conclusion:** Individual species responses more important than overall forb group response

**E. Palatable ANPP**

**Definition:** Total ANPP minus non-palatable forb ANPP

**Both habitats:**
- **Decreased by ~10 g/m²/yr** (P<0.05)
- Consistent effect across meadow and shrubland sites

**Components of decline:**
1. Decreased graminoid production
2. Decreased *Gentiana straminea* (warm, no clip)
3. Increased *Stellera chamaejasme* (non-palatable)

**Implication:** **Warming reduced available forage** - contrary to hypothesis

### II. Warming Effects on Growing Season Length and Monthly Biomass (2000)

**A. Growing Season Length**

**Unexpected finding:**
- **Extended but did NOT advance** the time over which live biomass was available
- Contradicts hypothesis of advanced growing season

**Early season (May):**
- **No difference** in live biomass between warmed and non-warmed plots
- Regardless of clipping presence/absence

**Late season (October):**
- **Warm(no clip): INCREASED** live biomass by **75 g/m²** (P<0.05)
- Warm(+clip): No effect
- **Warm×clip interaction** for October biomass

**Mid-season (June-September):**
- Warming generally decreased biomass
- Decline smaller in presence of clipping than absence

**B. Within-Season Warm×Clip Interactions**

**Important finding:** Monthly warming effects **depended on clipping presence**

Pattern across growing season:
- Early: No warming effect regardless of clipping
- Mid: Larger warming-induced decline without clipping
- Late: Warming increased biomass only without clipping

**Synergistic interaction:** Clipping moderated mid-season warming-induced biomass declines

### III. Warming Effects on Forage Nutritive Quality

**A. Direct Effects - Foliar N and C:N**

**Mixed and dynamic effects:**
- Varied by **year** (1998 vs. 2000)
- Varied by **plant group**
- Often **opposite directions** between years

**Sedges:**
- 1998: Warming **decreased** foliar N (P<0.05)
- 2000: Warming **increased** foliar N (P<0.05)
- 1998: Warming increased or had no effect on C:N
- 2000: Warming **decreased** C:N (P<0.05) - improved quality

**Shrubs:**
- 1998: Warming **decreased** foliar N (P<0.05)
- 2000: Warming **increased** foliar N (P<0.05)
- 1998: Warming **increased** C:N (P<0.05) - decreased quality
- 2000: Warming **decreased** C:N (P<0.05) - improved quality

**Grasses:**
- **No warming effect** on foliar N (both years)
- **No warming effect** on C:N (both years)

**Forbs:**
- **No warming effect** on foliar N (both years)
- **No warming effect** on C:N (both years)

**Interpretation:**
- **More complex than predicted** (did not consistently decrease quality)
- **Year-to-year variation** suggests dynamic responses
- Possible mechanism: Warming increased soil inorganic N (+52% to +140%; Klein et al. 2004)
  - Increased N availability may have increased foliar N in 2000
  - Direct warming effects on chemistry may be species-specific and context-dependent

**B. Indirect Effects - Plant Group Shifts**

**Van Soest fiber analysis results:**

**Digestible Dry Matter (DDM) ranking:**
1. **Sedge: 65% DDM** (highest quality)
2. **Forb: 65% DDM** (highest quality)
3. **Grass: 54% DDM** (intermediate)
4. **Shrub: 25% DDM** (lowest quality)

Shrubs vs. sedges/forbs differ significantly (P<0.05)
Grass differs from shrubs at P<0.1

**Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) - non-fibrous compounds:**
- Ranking: Forb < Shrub < Sedge < Grass
- Forbs and shrubs had **highest % digestible cell contents**

**Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) - cellulose + lignin + silica:**
- Ranking: Forb < Sedge < Grass = Shrub
- **Shrubs had high ADF** (more structural material)

**Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL):**
- **Shrubs significantly higher** than all other groups (P<0.05)
- Forbs, grasses, sedges did not differ from each other
- **Lignin not digestible** - major quality reducer

**Silica (AIA):**
- Ranking: Forb < Sedge = Grass < Shrub
- **Shrubs highest in silica**

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
**Warming-induced replacement of graminoids (60% DDM) with shrubs (25% DDM) represents MAJOR rangeland quality decline**

This **indirect effect through plant group composition** likely **more important than subtle direct effects on foliar chemistry within groups**

### IV. Clipping (Simulated Grazing) Effects on ANPP

**A. Total ANPP**

**General effect:**
- **Increased or no effect** depending on year
- Opposite direction from warming effects

**Year-specific responses:**
- 1998: No effect
- 1999: **Increased by ~35 g/m²** (P<0.05)
- 2000: No effect (when averaged over warming presence/absence)
- 2001: Clip(no warm) **decreased** by ~22 g/m² (P<0.05)

**Overall pattern across years:**
- **Increased by 20-40 g/m²/yr** in years with significant effects
- Effect robust across habitats and grazing history sites

**Evidence of "overcompensation":**
- Consistent with Turner et al. (1993) overcompensation theory
- Conditions favoring overcompensation met:
  1. Long evolutionary history of grazing ✓
  2. Low grazing consumption (15-30% removal) ✓
  3. Ample soil moisture during growing season ✓

**Validation:** Clipped vs. grazed plots not significantly different for total ANPP

**B. Palatable ANPP**

- **No significant effect** (both years)
- Remained ~220-250 g/m²/yr

**C. Graminoid ANPP**

- **No effect** (both habitats, all years)
- Contrary to warming effects (which decreased graminoids)

**D. Shrub Foliar ANPP (Shrublands Only)**

**Strong decrease:**
- **Decreased by ~35 g/m²/yr** in 2000 and 2001 (P<0.05)
- No effect in 1998-1999

**Consistency with long-term grazing experiment:**
- LG shrubland control plots: More shrub ANPP
- HG shrubland control plots: Less shrub ANPP
- After 15 years of different grazing intensities (Zhou et al. 2004)
- **Higher grazing → lower shrub ANPP**

**Validation:** Clipped vs. grazed plots similar for shrub ANPP

**Contrast with arid systems:**
- Many arid systems: Grazing increases shrubs (Schlesinger et al. 1990)
- **This system: Clipping/grazing decreases shrubs**

**Possible mechanisms for shrub decrease:**
1. High mean annual precipitation (600 mm/yr)
2. *Potentilla fruticosa* prefers moister areas
3. Fire not important process in this system
4. Sheep browse shrubs (especially early growing season)
5. Deciduous shrub species characteristics

**Rangeland quality implication:** **Clipping improved quality** by reducing less-digestible shrubs

**E. Forb ANPP**

**Overall effect:**
- **Increased** (P<0.05)
- Opposite to warming effect (no effect)

**Species-specific responses:**

*Stellera chamaejasme* (non-palatable):
- Clip(no warm): **No effect** (~2 g/m²/yr)
- Clip(+warm): No effect
- **Decreased rangeland quality** (non-palatable forb not suppressed)

*Oxytropis* spp. (non-palatable):
- Clip(no warm): **INCREASED** from ~2 g/m²/yr to ~14 g/m²/yr (P<0.05)
- Clip(+warm): No effect
- **Clip×warm interaction present**
- **Decreased rangeland quality** (non-palatable forb increased)

*Gentiana straminea* (medicinal):
- Clip(no warm): No effect (~37 g/m²/yr)
- Clip(+warm): No effect (~23 g/m²/yr)

**Conclusion:** Forb species identity more important than overall forb response

### V. Clipping Effects on Growing Season and Monthly Biomass (2000)

**A. Growing Season Length**

**Both extended and advanced** - supporting hypothesis

**Effects varied by habitat:**

**Meadows (winter-grazed):**
- **Advanced:** Increased biomass in **May** (+20 g/m², P<0.05) and **June** (P<0.05)
- **Extended:** Increased biomass in **October** (+117 g/m² without warming, P<0.05)

**Shrublands (summer-grazed):**
- **Not advanced:** No effect in May or June
- **Extended:** Increased biomass in **October** (+117 g/m² without warming, P<0.05)

**October biomass increase:**
- **Clip(no warm): +117 g/m²** - very large effect
- **Clip(+warm): +39 g/m²** - smaller effect
- **Clip×warm interaction:** Clipping effect three times larger without warming

**B. Within-Season Clip×Warm Interactions**

**Monthly clipping effects depended on warming:**

**May:**
- Combined treatments: **+20 g/m²** (P<0.05)
- Advancement of growing season

**July:**
- Combined treatments: **-40 g/m²** decrease
- Additive effects: **-75 g/m²** decrease
- **Synergistic interaction dampened** mid-season decline

**October:**
- Combined treatments: **+117 g/m²** (P<0.05)
- Both extended season and synergistic interaction present

**Implication:** **Important improvement to rangeland quality**
- Earlier forage availability
- Later forage availability
- Critical for herd survival (animals lose 50-80% body weight in winter on senesced vegetation)
- Highest mortality in spring when animals weak and late storms common

### VI. Clipping Effects on Forage Nutritive Quality

**A. Direct Effects - Foliar N and C:N**

**Generally supported hypothesis** that clipping increases quality

**Forbs:**
- **Increased** foliar N regardless of year (P=0.1)
- No effect on C:N

**Grasses:**
- 1998 (both habitats): **Increased** foliar N (P<0.05)
- 2000 (shrublands only): **Increased** foliar N (P<0.05)
- **Decreased** C:N both years (P<0.05)
- **Larger decline at shrublands** than meadows

**Sedges:**
- 2000 (both habitats): **Increased** foliar N (P<0.05)
- 2000: **Decreased** C:N (P<0.05)
- No effect in 1998

**Shrubs:**
- No effect on foliar N (both years)
- No effect on C:N (both years)

**Pattern:** Clipping effects more **consistent across years** than warming effects

**B. Indirect Effects - Plant Group Shifts**

**Key finding:** Clipping reduced less-digestible shrubs (25% DDM)

**At shrubland habitats:**
- Decreased shrub ANPP by 35 g/m²/yr (2000-2001)
- No effect on more-digestible graminoid ANPP (60% DDM)
- **Net improvement in forage quality**

**Contrast with warming:**
- Warming: Shrubs replaced graminoids (quality decline)
- Clipping: Reduced shrubs, maintained graminoids (quality improvement)

### VII. Combined Warming + Clipping Effects

**A. Total ANPP**

**Critical finding:** **No significant effect** on total ANPP

**Mechanism:** Warming and clipping effects **cancelled each other**
- Warming: Decreased ANPP (meadows)
- Clipping: Increased ANPP (both habitats, some years)
- Combined: No net effect

**B. Palatable ANPP**

**No significant effect**
- Similar cancellation pattern as total ANPP

**C. Graminoid ANPP**

**Moderate decrease:**
- **Declined by ~35 g/m²/yr** (P=0.09)
- Smaller decline than warming alone (36-50 g/m²/yr)
- **Clipping moderated** the larger warming-induced decline

**D. Shrub Foliar ANPP**

**No effect by 2000-2001**
- Warming increase (+20-25 g/m²/yr) cancelled by
- Clipping decrease (-35 g/m²/yr)

**E. Forb ANPP**

**Increased by ~20 g/m²/yr** (P<0.05)
- Reflected clipping effect (increased forbs)
- Warming had no overall effect on forbs

**F. Synergistic Interactions - Non-Additive Effects**

**MAJOR FINDING:** Combined effects **less severe** than sum of independent effects

**Quantitative example (2001 total ANPP):**
- **Strictly additive effect:** -82 g/m² (P<0.05)
  - = Warm(no clip) effect + Clip(no warm) effect
- **Actual combined effect:** -35 g/m² (not significant)
- **Difference:** Synergistic interaction dampened decline by ~47 g/m²

**Pattern observed for:**
- Total ANPP
- Palatable ANPP
- *Gentiana straminea* ANPP
- *Oxytropis* spp. ANPP
- *Aster flaccidus* ANPP
- *Morina chinensis* ANPP
- *Polygonum viviparum* ANPP

**Implication:** **Cannot predict combined global change effects from single-factor studies**

**G. Growing Season Effects**

**Combined treatments both advanced AND extended:**
- **May:** +20 g/m² live biomass (P<0.05) - **advanced**
- **July:** -40 g/m² live biomass (P<0.05) - mid-season decline
- **October:** +117 g/m² live biomass (P<0.05) - **extended**

**July decline:**
- Combined: -40 g/m²
- Additive: -75 g/m²
- **Synergistic interaction** dampened decline by 35 g/m²

**Net effect:** **Important rangeland quality improvement**
- Longer live forage availability period
- Critical for pastoral systems without supplemental feeding

**H. Forage Quality Effects**

**Generally increased or no effect:**

**Graminoids:**
- **Increased** grass foliar N (both years, P=0.09)
- **Increased** sedge foliar N (2000, P<0.05)
- **Decreased** sedge C:N (2000, P<0.05)
- No effect on grass C:N

**Shrubs and Forbs:**
- No effect on foliar N
- No effect on C:N

**Pattern:** Combined treatment effects **reflected clipping effects** (quality improvement)

**Plant group composition:**
- Reduced palatable graminoids (negative)
- No effect on less-palatable shrubs (no change from warming-induced increase)
- **Mixed net effect** on forage quality

### VIII. Grazing Management Can Mitigate Warming Effects

**Key finding:** Grazing (clipping) **mediated warming-induced declines**

**Evidence:**

1. **Synergistic interactions dampened declines:**
   - Combined effects less severe than additive predictions
   - Especially for ANPP, palatable ANPP, and forb species

2. **Shrub expansion control:**
   - Warming increased shrubs by 20-25 g/m²/yr
   - Clipping decreased shrubs by 35 g/m²/yr
   - Combined: No net effect on shrubs by 2000-2001
   - **Grazing can keep warming-induced shrub expansion in check**

3. **Graminoid decline moderation:**
   - Warming alone: -36 to -50 g/m²/yr
   - Combined: -35 g/m²/yr (P=0.09)
   - **Clipping reduced magnitude** of graminoid loss

4. **Monthly biomass patterns:**
   - Mid-season decline smaller with clipping present
   - Growing season length improvements maintained

**Management implications:**
- **Opportunistic, flexible grazing** will be required in warmer future
- Grazing timing and intensity important tools
- Challenges rigid, sedentary policies being imposed
- **Traditional mobile pastoralism** may be well-suited to future climate

## Root Biomass Results

**Measurement:** Soil cores to assess belowground biomass

**Finding:** Treatment effects on ANPP **NOT due to allocation shifts** between above and belowground pools

**Implication:** ANPP changes represent real productivity changes, not just reallocation of resources

**Details:** See Appendix C, Table C4 in original paper

## Mechanisms and Processes

### Warming Effects - Explanatory Mechanisms

**1. Vegetation Composition Changes**

**At shrublands:**
- **Shrub-graminoid competition**
  - Negative correlation between shrub and grass ANPP (r=-0.7, n=114)
  - Warming stimulates shrubs → shrubs suppress graminoids
  - Similar to competition-mediated responses (Dunnett & Grime 1999)

**At meadows:**
- No shrubs to compensate for graminoid decline
- Graminoid decline = total ANPP decline

**2. Abiotic Stress**

**Soil moisture:**
- Warming decreased soil moisture (Klein et al. 2005)
  - HG meadow: All warmed plots drier
  - LG meadow: Warm+clip plots drier
- May explain graminoid declines, especially at meadows

**Temperature stress:**
- High leaf temperatures in OTCs
- Maximum daily air temperature +2.1 to +7.3°C
- Could cause photosynthetic stress

**3. Phenological Stress**

- Extended growing season (October biomass increase)
- Sudden onset of winter conditions
- Plants may experience:
  - **Frost damage** to late-season growth
  - **Premature senescence** triggers
  - **Autumn hardening disruption**

**4. Litter Accumulation**

- Increased litter cover with warming (Klein et al. 2004)
- May suppress:
  - Seed germination
  - Seedling establishment
  - Growth of small plants

**5. Species Diversity Effects**

- Warming decreased species richness (Klein et al. 2004)
- Loss of species may have:
  - **Functional diversity** consequences
  - **Complementarity effects** on productivity
  - **Insurance effects** against stress

### Clipping Effects - Explanatory Mechanisms

**1. Overcompensation**

Conditions favoring overcompensation (Turner et al. 1993):
- ✓ Long evolutionary history of grazing
- ✓ Low consumption (15-30% removal)
- ✓ Ample soil moisture during growing season (600 mm, >80% monsoon)

**Mechanisms of overcompensation:**
- **Leaf age structure changes:** Younger, more photosynthetically active leaves (Briske 1991)
- **Compensatory growth:** Removal of apical dominance
- **Resource reallocation:** Mobilization of stored reserves
- **Extended photosynthetic period:** Delayed senescence

**2. Growing Season Extension**

**At meadows (winter-grazed):**
- Spring clipping before growth:
  - Stimulates **earlier regrowth** (advancement)
  - Removes dead material shading soil
  - Soil warms faster → earlier growth initiation

- Extended late season:
  - Younger tissue with delayed senescence
  - More live biomass in October

**At shrublands (summer-grazed):**
- Mid-July clipping:
  - No effect on early season (already past)
  - Stimulates regrowth
  - Delays senescence → **extended season**

**3. Forage Quality Improvement**

- **Direct:** Younger leaves have:
  - Higher N concentration
  - Lower C:N ratios
  - Lower lignin content
  - Higher digestibility

- **Indirect:** Reduced shrub production
  - Shrubs have 25% DDM
  - Maintaining graminoids with 60% DDM

### Combined Effects - Synergistic Interactions

**1. Dampened ANPP Declines**

**Possible mechanisms:**

- **Complementary resource use:**
  - Warming and clipping may create different resource bottlenecks
  - Plants respond differently to combined stresses
  - Non-linear responses to multiple factors

- **Phenological offsets:**
  - Warming extends late season
  - Clipping extends/advances season
  - Combined: Maximum extension with minimal overlap of negative effects

- **Species composition buffering:**
  - Warming favors shrubs
  - Clipping suppresses shrubs
  - Combined: Intermediate community composition
  - Diversity maintained → productivity buffered

**2. Statistical Interactions**

- **Warm×clip×year** interactions frequent
- **Warm×clip×habitat** interactions present
- **Warm×clip×month** interactions present
- Indicates **context-dependent responses**
- **Non-linear dynamics** important

### Why This System Differs from Other Alpine/Tundra Systems

**1. Asian Monsoon Climate**

**Precipitation pattern unique:**
- >80% precipitation in summer growing season
- Contrast: Rocky Mountains receive >80% as winter snow
- **Soil moisture NOT limiting** during growing season
- **Different controls on productivity**

**Winter characteristics:**
- Dry with occasional light snowfall
- Snow melts quickly (high solar radiation)
- Less snowpack accumulation effect

**Implications (Zobel & Singh 1997):**
- Himalayan forest properties can't be predicted from other regions
- **Same appears true for alpine rangelands**
- Monsoon climate creates unique ecosystem dynamics

**2. Grazing Evolutionary History**

**Long-term grazing pressure:**
- Millennia of pastoral land use
- **Wild ungulate assemblages** (Schaller 1998)
- Plants adapted to herbivory

**Consequences:**
- Overcompensation to moderate defoliation
- Different competitive hierarchies than ungrazed systems
- **Grazing integral to ecosystem function**

**3. Shrub Species and Dynamics**

***Potentilla fruticosa* characteristics:**
- **Deciduous** (unlike many tundra shrubs)
- Prefers **moister sites**
- **Browsed by sheep** (unlike evergreen shrubs)
- **Responds to grazing differently** than arid-land shrubs

**Fire absence:**
- Not important process in this system
- Contrast: Fire often favors shrubs in arid systems

**4. Temperature-Productivity Relationship**

**Most tundra warming studies:** Temperature limitation dominant
- Warming → extended growing season → more production
- Soil moisture usually adequate
- Temperature primary constraint

**This system:**
- **Warming can DECREASE production**
- Suggests temperature not sole limiting factor
- Other factors more important:
  - Competition dynamics
  - Phenological stress
  - Species-specific responses
  - Monsoon precipitation pattern

**5. Pastoral Land Use Context**

**Grazing integral to system:**
- 35% of Tibetan Plateau covered by this vegetation type
- >1 billion people downstream depend on these ecosystems
- **Grazing management** can mitigate climate effects
- **Human dimension** critical to understanding system

## Comparison to Other Studies

### Warming Effect on ANPP

**This study: DECREASED total ANPP**
- Rare finding in warming literature

**Most tundra studies: Increased or no effect**
- Hobbie & Chapin (1998): No net change in Alaska tundra
- Harte & Shaw (1995): No net change in Rocky Mountains
- Walker et al. (1999, 2006): Increased in most tundra sites
- Arft et al. (1999): Meta-analysis showed general increases
- Hollister et al. (2005): Increased in northern Alaska

**Rustad et al. (2001) meta-analysis across ecosystems:**
- 13/20 sites: Increased AG productivity
- 5/20 sites: No effect
- **2/20 sites: DECREASED** ← This study in rare category

**One similar study:**
- Saleska et al. (2002): Decreased productivity with soil warming in montane meadow
- Also unusual finding

### Grazing Effect on ANPP

**This study: INCREASED total ANPP**
- Evidence of overcompensation

**Literature mixed:**

**Studies showing increases:**
- Conditions: Long grazing history, low consumption, high productivity (Milchunas & Lauenroth 1993)
- This study meets all three conditions

**Studies showing decreases:**
- Milchunas & Lauenroth (1993) meta-analysis: **Most studies** showed negative effects
- 236 sites worldwide: Majority showed ANPP decline

**Studies showing no effect or variable:**
- Maschinski & Whitham (1989): Continuum of responses
- Vesk & Westoby (1991): Species-specific
- Painter & Belsky (1993): Context-dependent

**Important consideration:** Defoliation history matters (Turner et al. 1993)
- This system: Long evolutionary grazing history
- Supports overcompensation response

### Shrub Expansion with Warming

**This study: Shrubs increased +20-25 g/m²/yr**

**Consistent with many studies:**
- Harte & Shaw (1995): Rocky Mountain alpine
- Hobbie & Chapin (1998): Alaska tundra
- Arft et al. (1999): Meta-analysis - general pattern
- Walker et al. (2006): Across tundra biome
- Weltzin et al. (2000): Bog and fen systems
- Perfors et al. (2003): Sagebrush expansion
- Chapin et al. (2005): Alaska shrub expansion review

**Implications across studies:**
- Carbon storage changes
- Albedo effects
- Snow dynamics
- **This study adds: Forage quality implications**

### Shrub Response to Grazing

**This study: Grazing DECREASED shrubs**

**Contrast with many arid systems:**
- Schlesinger et al. (1990): Grazing increases shrubs in arid systems
- Hibbard et al. (2003): Grassland→woodland with grazing

**Explanations for difference:**
1. **Precipitation:** 600 mm/yr (not arid)
2. **Shrub species:** Deciduous, palatable to sheep
3. **Fire:** Not important here; often interacts with grazing in arid systems
4. **Grazing type:** Sheep browse shrubs here

**Supporting evidence:**
- 15-year grazing experiment: HG plots had less shrub ANPP than LG plots (Zhou et al. 2004)
- Consistent with clipping results

### Interactive Effects of Multiple Global Changes

**This study: Non-additive effects, synergistic interactions**

**Similar findings:**
- Dunnett & Grime (1999): Competition mediated warming effects on grasses vs. forbs
- Weltzin et al. (2000): Warming×water table interactions in peatlands
- Walker et al. (1999): Multiple factor interactions in tundra

**Contrast with simple additive models:**
- Many climate projections assume additive effects
- **This study shows: Combined effects ≠ sum of individual effects**
- **Interaction effect can dampen or amplify individual effects**

**Implications:**
- Single-factor studies insufficient
- Need multi-factor experiments
- Difficult to predict real-world responses

### Model Structure Implications

**1. Must Include Multiple Plant Functional Types**

**Minimum required:**
- Graminoids (grass + sedge, or separate)
- Forbs (multiple species if possible)
- Shrubs (deciduous)

**Why:** Opposite responses to warming and grazing
- Shrubs: +warm, -grazing
- Graminoids: -warm, no grazing effect
- Forbs: Species-specific, +grazing overall

**2. Competition Mechanisms Required**

**Shrub-graminoid competition:**
- Resource competition for light, water, nutrients
- Warming shifts competitive balance toward shrubs
- Important for capturing dynamics

**3. Grazing/Defoliation Module**

**Must capture:**
- Overcompensation at moderate intensities

- Differential selectivity (palatable vs non-palatable)
- Effects on phenology
- Effects on tissue quality

**4. Phenology Submodel**

**Key processes:**

- **Separate controls:** Warming extended but didn't advance season
- Growing season length effects on ANPP

**5. Interactive Effects Framework**

**Non-additive responses:**
- Can't use simple multiplicative models
- Need explicit interaction terms
- Context-dependent (year, habitat, grazing history)

**Statistical interactions to capture:**

3. **Grazing responses:**
   - Total ANPP: +20-40 g/m²/yr
   - Shrub ANPP: -35 g/m²/yr
   - Forb ANPP: +20 g/m²/yr

### Key Challenges for Modeling

**1. Individualistic Species Responses**

**Forb species responded very differently:**
- Some increased, some decreased, some no change
- Depended on warming, grazing, their interaction
- Difficult to parameterize without many species

**Simplification options:**
- Palatable vs non-palatable forb PFTs
- Aggregate to single forb PFT (loses information)
- Include key indicator species explicitly

**2. Context-Dependent Responses**

**Year-to-year variation:**
- Warming effects absent year 1, strong years 2-4
- Foliar chemistry opposite directions in 1998 vs 2000
- Requires dynamic state variables

**Habitat differences:**
- Meadows vs shrublands responded differently
- Related to shrub presence/absence
- May need separate parameterizations

**3. Non-Linear Interactions**

**Multiple interaction terms:**
- Warm×Clip
- Warm×Clip×Year
- Warm×Clip×Habitat
- Warm×Clip×Month
- Difficult to parameterize all

**Statistical approach:**
- Use interaction coefficients from ANOVAs
- Or mechanistic approach based on processes

**4. Monsoon Climate System**

**Unique precipitation pattern:**
- >80% in growing season
- Drives different limitations than snowmelt systems
- **May not have good analogs** for parameter transfer

**Soil moisture dynamics:**
- Available during growing season
- But can decline with warming
- Important control on responses

**5. Grazing Management Complexity**

**Real grazing differs from clipping:**
- Selectivity by species and tissue type
- Trampling effects
- Nutrient redistribution (urine, feces)
- Seasonal movement patterns

**This study:**
- Clipping approximated grazing well for ANPP
- But simplified compared to real systems
- Model may need more complexity

- Climate variability effects
- Non-stationary responses

**3. Spatial heterogeneity:**
- Grazing history effects
- Habitat differences
- Likely underlain by soil, microclimate variation

**4. Scaling:**
- 75×75 cm plots → landscape
- 4-year study → decadal predictions
- OTC microclimate → regional climate change

**5. Extrapolation limits:**
- OTCs: +1-2°C warming (what about +3-4°C?)
- Clipping: 15-30% removal (what about 50%?)
- 4 years duration (what about 20 years?)
