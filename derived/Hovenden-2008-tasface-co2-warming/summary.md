## Experimental Design

### Treatments (2×2 Full Factorial)

**12 mini-FACE rings total**

1. **Elevated CO₂ (FACE)**: 550 μmol mol⁻¹
   - Method: Pure-CO₂ FACE (Free Air CO₂ Enrichment)
   - Ring diameter: 1.4 m
   - Control: Ambient CO₂ (~385 ppm)
   - **Started**: February 2002

2. **Warming (T)**:
   - Method: Infrared radiation
   - Equipment: 240V 250W Emerson solid ceramic infrared emitters
   - Power: 140 W m⁻² added
   - Position: Suspended 1.2 m above soil surface above ring center
   - Operation: Continuous
   - **Achieved warming**:
     - Leaf temperature: +1.98°C (average over growing season)
     - Soil temperature at 1 cm: +0.82°C (average over growing season)
   - **Side effects**:
     - Canopy relative humidity at 5 cm: -5.1% (average reduction)
   - **Uniformity**: 92% of plot area warmed by 1.5-2.5°C
   - **Note**: Tall plants warmed more than short plants, but height variation only 5-10 cm in this short grass pasture
   - **Started**: February 2002

**Treatment combinations** (n=3 each):
- **Control**: Ambient CO₂ + ambient temperature
- **Warmed**: Ambient CO₂ + elevated temperature
- **FACE**: Elevated CO₂ + ambient temperature
- **F+W**: Elevated CO₂ + elevated temperature

**Replication**: n=3 per treatment (12 plots total)

**Plot Design**:
- Mini-FACE rings: 1.4 m diameter
- Small plots suitable for species-rich grassland

**Soil Monitoring**:
- Soil water potential: Two gypsum blocks per plot at 5-15 cm depth (ICT International, Armidale, Australia)
- Readings: Weekly
- Root distribution: 81 ± 10% of roots in top 50 mm

## Measurements - Soil N Availability

### Ion Exchange Membrane Method

**Why this method**:
- Ion exchange membranes interact with soil solution → act as "artificial roots"
- Provide measure of **plant-available N** rather than soil N concentration
- Capture low molecular weight (MW) dissolved organic N (DON)
- Low MW DON is predominantly amino acids (plant-accessible)
- Effectively compete for ammonium, nitrate, and low MW DON

**Method** (following Cain et al. 1999; Bowatte et al. 2007):
- Membrane sheets: 50 mm × 10 mm (VWR International Ltd, Poole, UK)
- Fixed to plastic plant labels (100 mm × 15 mm) to make "membrane soil sticks"
- Replication: 10 membrane soil sticks per plot
- Insertion: Pushed into soil until top of sheet at soil surface
- Effective depth sampled: 50 mm (81 ± 10% of roots in this region)
- Location: Random locations in each plot

**Sampling Strategy**:
- Timing: During maximum spring growth (ecologically relevant period)
- Frequency: Twice per spring in each year (2004, 2005, 2006)
- Duration: 14 days per deployment
- **Rationale**: Spring is only period with both sufficient soil moisture and warm temperatures for plant growth and microbial activity
- Plants dormant rest of year due to drought and/or cold

**Sample Processing**:
- Removal: After 14 days
- Cleaning: Washed with distilled water
- Extraction: 25 mL of 0.05 M HCl
- Analysis: FIAstar 5000 flow injection analyzer (Foss Tecator AB, Hoeganaes, Sweden)

**Analytes**:
- Nitrate (NO₃⁻)
- Ammonium (NH₄⁺)
- Total soluble N
- **DON**: Calculated as total soluble N minus mineral N

**Data Handling**:
- 20 estimates per plot per spring (2 samples × 10 sticks)
- Pooled to provide single estimate per plot per spring

## Key Results - Temporal Patterns

### Ambient Baseline Conditions (Control Plots)

**Soil water potential during spring** (mean ± SE kPa):
- 2004: -97.2 ± 17.4 (driest)
- 2005: -29.4 ± 5.8 (wettest)
- 2006: -164.4 ± 34.5 (very dry)

**Total available soil N** (μg N resin⁻¹ 14 day⁻¹):
- 2004: ~10
- 2005: ~13
- 2006: ~12

### DON Temporal Decline (No Treatment Effects)

**DON as fraction of total available N**:
- Spring 2004: 62.4 ± 2.1% (MAJOR fraction)
- Spring 2005: 21.2 ± 2.6% (DECLINED substantially)
- Spring 2006: 14.4 ± 1.6% (DECLINED further)

**DON availability** (μg N resin⁻¹ 14 day⁻¹):
- Varied among years
- NO significant treatment effects in any year
- NO effect of elevated CO₂ or warming on DON availability
- NO effect on relative proportion of total N as DON

**Interpretation**: Natural interannual variation in DON, but not affected by climate treatments

## Treatment Effects

### Year 3 (Spring 2004) - NO EFFECTS

**Total available N**: P = 0.15 (not significant)
**Mineral N**: P = 0.15 (not significant)
**Ammonium**: P = 0.55 (not significant)
**Nitrate**: P = 0.28 (not significant)
**DON**: No significant effects

**Interpretation**: After 3 years of treatment, no effects yet detectable

### Year 4 (Spring 2005) - EFFECTS EMERGE

**Total available N**:
- **Significant CO₂ × Warming × Time interaction**: P < 0.001
- **Unwarmed FACE**: -47.3% vs control (P < 0.001) - MAJOR REDUCTION
- **Warmed FACE (F+W)**: No reduction (similar to control)
- **Warmed alone**: No significant effect
- **KEY FINDING**: Warming prevented CO₂-induced N reduction

**Mineral N**:
- **Unwarmed FACE**: -47.3% vs control (P < 0.001)
- Pattern matches total N (DON unchanged → mineral N drives total N)
- Unwarmed FACE prevented the substantial increase in mineral N that occurred in all other treatments between 2004 and 2005

**Ammonium**:
- **Both FACE and F+W**: Significantly lower than both controls (P < 0.001)
- **No warming effect** on CO₂ response for ammonium
- Elevated CO₂ reduced extent of substantial increase in soil ammonium availability
- **Note**: 2005 had highest spring rainfall and soil water potential

**Nitrate**:
- **Unwarmed FACE vs Warmed FACE**: Significant difference (P < 0.03)
- **Warmed FACE (F+W)**: More than DOUBLE the nitrate of unwarmed FACE
- **Warmed FACE**: HIGHEST nitrate availability of any treatment
- **KEY FINDING**: Warming reversed CO₂ effect specifically for nitrate

**Soil water potential** (2005):
- Control unwarmed: -29.4 ± 5.8 kPa
- Control warmed: -41.2 ± 8.1 kPa
- FACE unwarmed: -21.0 ± 3.0 kPa
- FACE warmed: -42.7 ± 11.3 kPa
- Unwarmed FACE and control did NOT differ significantly (rules out moisture as primary driver)

### Year 5 (Spring 2006) - EFFECTS PERSIST AND STRENGTHEN

**Total available N**:
- **Unwarmed FACE**: -49.6% vs control (P < 0.004)
- **Warmed FACE (F+W)**: No reduction
- **Pattern consistent with 2005**

**Mineral N**:
- Mirrors total N pattern
- Unwarmed FACE remained low while all other treatments increased

**Ammonium**:
- **No significant treatment effects** in 2006
- Differences from 2005 had disappeared
- Ammonium availability declined between 2005 and 2006 in all treatments

**Nitrate**:
- Nitrate availability INCREASED 2005→2006 in all plots EXCEPT unwarmed FACE
- **Unwarmed FACE**: Nitrate remained largely unchanged
- **All other treatments**: Substantial increases
- **Conclusion**: Reduction in mineral N in unwarmed FACE was primarily due to reduction in nitrate

**Soil water potential** (2006):
- Control unwarmed: -164.4 ± 34.5 kPa
- Control warmed: -132.1 ± 33.2 kPa
- FACE unwarmed: -148.0 ± 17.3 kPa
- FACE warmed: -167.9 ± 8.4 kPa
- Very dry year

## Major Findings

### 1. Delayed CO₂ Effect on Soil N Availability

**Timeline**:
- Year 3 (2004): No effects
- Year 4 (2005): Strong CO₂ effect emerges (-47.3%)
- Year 5 (2006): Effect persists and strengthens (-49.6%)

**Supports**: Progressive Nitrogen Limitation (PNL) theory (Luo et al. 2004)
- Gradual development of N limitation under elevated CO₂
- Not immediate response

### 2. Warming Completely Prevented CO₂-Induced N Reduction

**Significant CO₂ × Warming Interaction**: P < 0.001

**Effect patterns**:
- **FACE alone**: -47% to -50% reduction in soil N
- **Warming alone**: No significant effect
- **FACE + Warming**: No reduction (like ambient)

**Interpretation**: Warming nullified the elevated CO₂-induced reduction in available N

**Contrast with Dijkstra et al. 2010**:
- Dijkstra: NO CO₂ × warming interaction (additive effects)
- Hovenden: SIGNIFICANT CO₂ × warming interaction
- Different ecosystems may respond differently

### 3. CO₂ Effect Primarily on Nitrate Availability

**Year 4-5 pattern**:
- Total N reduction driven by mineral N
- Mineral N reduction primarily nitrate
- Ammonium showed transient CO₂ effect in 2005 only
- DON unaffected

**Nitrate-specific finding** (2005):
- Warmed FACE: HIGHEST nitrate of all treatments
- Unwarmed FACE: LOWEST nitrate
- More than 2× difference between warmed and unwarmed FACE

**Nitrogen transformation pathway affected**:
- Organic N → ammonium → nitrite → nitrate
- CO₂ effects manifested at later stages of transformation

### 4. No CO₂ Stimulation of Plant Productivity

**Important context**:
- Elevated CO₂ did NOT increase biomass production in any year (data not shown)
- Differs from many FACE experiments showing CO₂ fertilization
- Suggests increased plant N sink NOT the mechanism for N reduction

**Implications**:
- N reduction due to OTHER mechanisms (microbial, not plant uptake)
- N limitation may have PREVENTED CO₂ fertilization effect in years 4-5

### 5. Microbial Mechanisms Likely

**Evidence for microbial immobilization**:
1. No increased plant N sink (no productivity increase)
2. CO₂ effect on N emerged in years 4-5 (time for microbial responses)
3. Ammonium reduction in 2005 (wet year) suggests enhanced microbial activity
4. Literature: Elevated CO₂ → increased soil C → enhanced microbial activity (+17.7% meta-analysis, de Graaff et al. 2006)

**Proposed "CO₂-priming effect"**:
- Elevated CO₂ → increased plant C inputs to soil
- Increased soil C → C-limited soil microbes stimulated
- Enhanced microbial activity → increased N immobilization
- Reduced plant-available N

**Warming effect on mechanism**:
- Plants in unwarmed FACE allocated MORE biomass to roots
- Plants in warmed FACE allocated LESS to roots (data not shown)
- Hypothesis: CO₂-priming effect only occurs without warming
- Warming alters plant C allocation → prevents enhanced root C inputs → prevents microbial N immobilization

### 6. Alternative Mechanisms for Nitrate Reduction

**Nitrification pathway**:
- Organic N → ammonium → nitrifiers → nitrite → nitrate
- Elevated CO₂ + increased root C inputs → enhanced heterotrophic ammonium uptake
- Heterotrophs compete with nitrifiers for ammonium
- Reduced nitrification → reduced nitrate

**Literature support**:
- Trenching experiment (Ross et al. 2001): Reducing root C inputs increased nitrification
- Hungate et al. (1997, 1999): Elevated CO₂ increased heterotrophic NH₄⁺ uptake, decreased nitrification
- Mikan et al. (2000): Similar findings

**Warming effect**:
- Warming alters plant C allocation (less root allocation under warming + CO₂)
- Reduced root C inputs → less heterotrophic competition → maintained nitrification → maintained nitrate

### 7. Precipitation/Moisture NOT Primary Driver

**Evidence**:
- Soil water potential did NOT differ significantly between unwarmed FACE and control (Table 1)
- Yet N availability differed greatly between these treatments
- Rules out moisture differences as primary mechanism

**Contrast with Dijkstra et al. 2010**:
- Dijkstra: Soil moisture KEY mediator (CO₂ increased moisture → microbial immobilization)
- Hovenden: Soil moisture NOT the primary mechanism
- Different ecosystems, different mechanisms

### 8. DON Temporal Pattern Unaffected by Treatments

**Natural decline 2004→2006**:
- 62% → 21% → 14% of total N
- Possibly related to interannual climate variation
- NOT affected by CO₂ or warming treatments

**Interpretation**:
- DON pool responds to natural climate variability
- But not sensitive to experimental climate change (at least in short term)

### 9. Implications for Progressive N Limitation (PNL)

**PNL Theory** (Luo et al. 2004):
- Elevated CO₂ increases C fixation
- Increased C → enhanced N sink in soil biota
- N immobilization → reduced plant-available N
- Reduced N availability → limits CO₂ fertilization effect

**This study provides evidence**:
- ✓ Delayed effect (years 4-5, not year 3)
- ✓ Reduced soil N availability under elevated CO₂
- ✓ No CO₂ stimulation of productivity (possibly N-limited)
- ✓ Likely microbial immobilization mechanism

**But with critical caveat**:
- Warming can PREVENT this process
- Future climate = both elevated CO₂ AND warming
- PNL may NOT develop if warming offsets CO₂ effects on N

**Uncertainty**:
- This ecosystem: CO₂ did not stimulate productivity
- In ecosystems with strong CO₂ fertilization, would warming-induced N mineralization be SUFFICIENT to overcome increased plant N demand?
- Open question

### Model Testing Opportunities

1. **Can EcoSIM reproduce the CO₂ × warming interaction?**
   - Dijkstra: Additive (no interaction)
   - Hovenden: Antagonistic interaction (warming prevents CO₂ effect)
   - What ecosystem/soil differences lead to interactions vs additivity?

2. **Does model capture delayed CO₂ effects?**
   - Year 3: No effect
   - Years 4-5: Strong effect
   - Requires temporal dynamics of microbial responses

3. **Can model simulate warming effect on plant C allocation?**
   - Unwarmed FACE: High root allocation
   - Warmed FACE: Lower root allocation
   - Critical for mechanism

4. **Does model reproduce nitrate-specific effects?**
   - CO₂ effect strongest on nitrate
   - Transient effect on ammonium
   - No effect on DON
   - Requires explicit nitrification pathway

5. **Can model capture microbial competition for ammonium?**
   - Heterotrophs vs nitrifiers
   - Depends on soil C availability
   - Affects nitrate production

6. **Does model predict PNL development?**
   - Gradual (years 3→5) reduction in N availability
   - Possible limitation of CO₂ fertilization effect
   - But prevented by warming

7. **What conditions lead to CO₂ stimulation of productivity?**
   - This study: No CO₂ fertilization effect
   - Is N limitation preventing response?
   - Or other factors?

8. **Long-term predictions**:
   - Will interaction persist beyond 5 years?
   - Would stronger warming have different effects?
   - Will N limitation eventually constrain productivity even with warming?

  - Contrast with Ma et al. (lab incubations) and Dijkstra et al. (¹⁵N tracer)
- **No gaseous N losses**:
  - N₂O, N₂ not measured
  - Complete N budget not possible
  - Denitrification unknown

**Temporal**:
- **Spring-only measurements**:
  - Captures growth season (ecologically relevant)
  - But misses rest of year (though plants dormant)
  - Cannot assess year-round dynamics
- **Two samples per spring**:
  - Limited temporal resolution within season
  - May miss peak availability or short-term responses
- **Only years 3-5**:
  - No data for years 1-2
  - Cannot assess immediate responses
- **5 years total**:
  - Moderate duration
  - Longer-term trajectories unknown
  - Will effects persist? Strengthen? Reverse?

**Environmental**:
- **Drought during study period**:
  - Mean 322 mm vs long-term 560 mm (42% lower)
  - All 3 years drier than normal
  - Responses may differ in wetter periods
  - Limits generalizability
- **2005 unusual**:
  - Much higher spring rainfall than 2004 or 2006
  - Strongest treatment effects in this year
  - Suggests moisture interactions (though not measured)

**Analysis**:
- **Limited statistical power** (n=3)
  - May miss small effects or subtle interactions
  - Conservative test of hypotheses
- **No multivariate analysis**:
  - Each N form analyzed separately
  - Could use PCA or similar to assess overall patterns
- **No path analysis or SEM**:
  - Mechanisms inferred, not tested statistically
  - Cannot quantify direct vs indirect effects

**Interpretation**:
- **Mechanisms uncertain**:
  - No direct measurements of proposed pathways
  - Plant C allocation changes mentioned but not shown
  - Microbial processes inferred
  - Alternative mechanisms possible
- **Interaction with drought**:
  - Low rainfall during study
  - Would results differ in normal or wet years?
  - CO₂ × warming × precipitation interaction?

### Uncertainty Sources:
- Small sample size (n=3)
- Spatial heterogeneity within small plots
- Temporal variability (especially 2005 vs 2004/2006)
- Drought effects (all years drier than normal)
- Ion exchange membrane method assumptions
- Inferring mechanisms without direct measurements
- Plot size effects (small rings)
- Infrared warming artifacts (RH reduction)

## Relevance to Warming/Nitrogen Meta-Analysis

**Very high relevance**:

1. **CO₂ × warming factorial design**:
   - Direct test of interactive effects
   - One of few grassland studies with both factors

2. **Significant interaction finding**:
   - Warming PREVENTS CO₂ effect
   - Contrasts with Dijkstra (additive)
   - Shows interactions are context-dependent

3. **Progressive Nitrogen Limitation demonstrated**:
   - Clear delayed effect pattern
   - Years 4-5 effects emerged
   - Supports PNL theory

4. **Warming as potential solution**:
   - Future climate = CO₂ + warming together
   - Warming may offset CO₂-induced N limitation
   - But: Does this apply if CO₂ stimulates productivity?

5. **Geographic coverage**:
   - Southern Hemisphere (Australia)
   - Complements Northern Hemisphere sites
   - Mediterranean-type climate

6. **Ecosystem diversity**:
   - Species-rich temperate grassland
   - Complements simpler grasslands (Dijkstra) and heathlands (Larsen)
   - 64 plant species

7. **Plant-microbe interactions**:
   - Plant C allocation as key mechanism
   - Warming alters plant behavior → affects microbial processes
   - Indirect climate effects via plant responses

8. **Nitrate-specific effects**:
   - Nitrification pathway most affected
   - Different from other N transformations
   - Helps identify vulnerable processes

9. **Temporal dynamics**:
   - Multi-year data shows development
   - Not just snapshot
   - Can assess trajectory of change

10. **Ion exchange membrane method**:
    - Different from soil cores (Dijkstra) or incubations (Ma)
    - Plant-available N (ecologically relevant)
    - Methodological diversity for meta-analysis

**Integration opportunities**:
- Test when CO₂ × warming interactions occur vs not
- Compare across precipitation gradients (Hovenden dry, Larsen wet, Dijkstra semiarid)
- Compare across soil pH (Hovenden 6.0, Dijkstra 7.9, Ma 8.2, Larsen 4-5)
- Assess ecosystem complexity effects (64 species vs simpler systems)
- Evaluate Southern vs Northern Hemisphere responses
- Test PNL theory across systems
- Identify conditions where warming offsets CO₂ effects

## Notes

- **Directly referenced by Dijkstra et al. 2010** as having opposite finding (interaction vs no interaction)
- **TasFACE** is one of the few mini-FACE experiments suitable for species-rich communities
- **Key surprise**: Warming completely prevented CO₂ effect (interaction, not just main effects)
- **Mechanism unclear**: Plant C allocation changes inferred but not directly measured
- **PNL demonstrated**: Clear support for Progressive Nitrogen Limitation theory
- **Caveat**: No CO₂ fertilization effect in this system (N-limited from start?)
- **Precipitation context**: All 3 years drier than normal (42% lower) - drought-stressed system
- **2005 anomaly**: Wettest of 3 years, strongest treatment effects - suggests moisture interactions
- **Nitrate key**: Reduction primarily in NO₃⁻, not NH₄⁺ or DON - nitrification affected
- **Contrast with Dijkstra**: Same treatments (CO₂ × warming) but opposite interaction patterns
- **Implications**: Warming could prevent PNL in some ecosystems, but not universal
- **Open questions**:
  - Would results differ if CO₂ stimulated productivity?
  - Would results differ in normal/wet years?
  - What happens beyond year 5?
  - Are mechanisms correctly inferred?
