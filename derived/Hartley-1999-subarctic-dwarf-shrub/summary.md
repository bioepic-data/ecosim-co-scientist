## Study Significance

This 5-year soil warming experiment in subarctic Sweden demonstrates that:
1. **Direct soil warming (+5°C) stimulates soil N cycling and shrub growth in the SHORT TERM (2-3 years)**
2. **Long-term responses (year 5) may be less dramatic than short-term changes**
3. **High-dose fertilization studies DO NOT accurately simulate N availability increases predicted for climate warming**
4. **Even extreme climate warming scenarios will not increase plant-available N to levels used in fertilization experiments**

This is one of the first studies to show that short-term warming responses may not persist long-term, and that fertilization studies overestimate the magnitude of N availability changes expected with climate warming.

## Experimental Design

### Plot Layout and Treatments

**Main warming plot:**
- **One large 4.8 × 6 m plot** with buried heating cables
- **Heating cables** buried in humic layer **5 cm below soil surface**
- **Power density**: Not specified, but sufficient to achieve +5°C
- **Heated area divided into 20 1-m² subplots** for sampling

**Control plots:**
- **Four sets of control plots** at corners of main heated plot
- Each set contained:
  - **1 m² "Control"** - completely untreated
  - **1 m² "Disturbance Control"** - unheated buried cables (accounts for disturbance effect)

**Temperature monitoring:**
- **Warmed plot**: 5 thermistors recording every 2 hours
- **Control plots**: 3 thermistors each
- **Heating system**: Cables heated when temperature difference between heated and control plots at 5-cm depth dropped below 5°C
- **Heating season**: From snowmelt to first frost each year

### Treatment Details

#### 1993-1997: Soil Warming Only
- **Target soil temperature increase**: +5°C at 5 cm depth
- **Achieved increase**: 5.0 ± 0.5°C
- **Duration**: 17 June to 16 September 1993; similar period each year through 1997
- **Applied continuously** from snowmelt to first frost

#### 1994: Soil + Air Warming (Tents)
- **Four 1-m² plots** within heated area received additional air warming
- **Method**: Small plastic tents (0.75 m tall, vented)
- **Temperature increase achieved**:
  - Soil warming: +4.3°C (above ambient)

- **Measurements**: Julian days 227-237

#### 1995: Soil + Air Warming (Open-Top Chambers)
- **Same four plots** as 1994
- **Method**: ITEX-style open-top chambers (replaced tents to decrease rain interception, increase air warming)
- **Temperature increase achieved**:
  - Soil warming: +5.4°C (above ambient)
  - Air warming: +2.1°C (above soil-warmed plots)
- **Measurements**: 24-hour monitoring on Julian days 202-204

## Methods

### Soil Nitrogen Cycling

#### In Situ Net N Mineralization (Buried Bag Technique)
**Measured in: 1993, 1994, 1997 (season-long incubations)**

**Sampling procedure:**
1. **Initial cores** (5-cm diameter × 10-cm deep) collected from 3 disturbance control + 3 warmed plots
2. **Two paired cores** removed next to each initial core for incubation
3. **Soil preparation**: Coarse roots and rocks culled; **unsieved soil** buried in polyethylene bags at 5 cm depth
4. **Timing**: Samples collected and buried at snowmelt; retrieved at end of growing season

**Laboratory analysis:**
1. **Initial and final samples**: 10-g subsample extracted in 100 ml of 2 M KCl
2. **Extraction**: Shaken vigorously 1 hour, filtered after 24 hours
3. **Moisture**: Remainder dried at 105°C for 48 hours
4. **Inorganic N analysis**: Colorimetric on Alpkem RFA autoanalyzer
   - **NH₄⁺**: Phenol hypochlorite method
   - **NO₃⁻**: Cadmium reduction method

**Calculations:**
- **Net N mineralization** = change in total inorganic N (NH₄⁺ + NO₃⁻) during growing season
- **Net nitrification** = change in NO₃⁻ content

**Limitations acknowledged by authors:**
1. **Moisture**: Captures soil moisture at one point in time (snowmelt); buried soils were moister than surrounding soils → may overestimate net N mineralization
2. **No root-mycorrhizal interactions**: Buried bags prohibit study of root-fungal effects on N cycling
3. **No information on organic N**: Buried bag method doesn't assess importance of organic N in plant nutrition

### Plant Phenology

**Years measured**: 1994, 1995, 1997
**Frequency**: 1-2 week intervals during growing season
**Sampling**: 10 individuals per species in 4 plots per treatment

**Phenological stages recorded:**
1. **Bud break** (E. hermaphroditum, V. vitis-idaea)
2. **Leaf emergence** (all 4 species)
3. **Leaf maturation** (all 4 species)
   - Defined as **full expansion** for V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea

**Data presentation**: Percentage of plants reaching each stage by given date

### Current-Year Aboveground Biomass

**Years measured**: 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 (peak biomass ~early August)
**Sampling**: 6 randomly selected shoots per plot per species (4 plots per treatment)

**Measurements per shoot:**
1. **Stem length** (mm)
2. **Stem dry mass** (mg)
3. **Leaf dry mass** (mg)
4. **Leaf number** (V. myrtillus, V. uliginosum, V. vitis-idaea only)
5. **Leaf area** (cm²) (V. myrtillus, V. uliginosum, V. vitis-idaea only)
   - Measured using Digital Image Analysis System (Delta-T Devices Ltd., England)

**Derived metrics:**
- **Leaf weight ratio** = dry leaf mass / (dry stem + leaf mass)
  - Assesses allocation to leaves vs. stems in current-year growth

**Foliar N concentration:**
- Live and senescent leaf tissue pooled per species per plot
- **Total N analyzed** on Perkin-Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer

### Plant Cover

**Years measured**: 1993, 1994, 1997 (early August, peak biomass)
**Method**: Modified point intercept
**Sampling**: 4 plots per treatment

**Procedure:**
1. **0.5-m² frame** positioned into 4 permanently installed pipes in center of each plot
2. **Two-tiered grid** with **121 sampling points** spaced at 5-cm intervals
3. **Sighting down crosshairs**, recorded species observed
4. **Number of total observations** per species = relative estimate of plant cover

**Categories recorded:**
- **Dwarf shrubs**: E. hermaphroditum, V. myrtillus, V. uliginosum, V. vitis-idaea (individual species)
- **Grasses**: Calamagrostis lapponica, Deschampsia flexuosa (combined)
- **Forbs**: Linnaea borealis, Rubus chamaemorus (combined)
- **Mosses** (combined)
- **Lichens** (combined)

### Statistical Analysis

**Approach**: Year-by-year analysis using **one-way ANOVA**
- **Reason**: Different treatments applied in different years (soil vs. soil+air)
- **Post-hoc test**: Bonferroni (for comparing treatment means)
- **Significance level**: p < 0.05
- **Transformations**: Applied when necessary to meet ANOVA assumptions
- **Nonparametric alternative**: Wilcoxon rank sum or Kruskal-Wallis test when ANOVA assumptions not met

**Software:**
- **JMP** (SAS Institute Inc. 1996): Shapiro-Wilk W normality test, Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variance, nonparametric tests
- **Data Desk** (Data Description Inc. 1993): ANOVA and other analyses

**Important note on replication:**
- **Soil warming treatment NOT replicated** (single 4.8 × 6 m plot)
- **Rationale**: Minimize disturbance; avoid strong edge effects; allow destructive sampling
- **Pseudoreplication acknowledged** but necessary given constraints

## Discussion and Interpretation

### Soil Nitrogen Cycling Responses

#### Short-Term Enhancement (Year 2)
**Net N mineralization doubled in year 2** (4.3 → 9.2 kg N ha⁻¹ season⁻¹) with 5°C soil warming.

**Why did this occur?**
- **Direct soil warming of 4-5°C sufficient to stimulate N-mineralizing microbes**
- Contrast to previous field experiments with only 1-2°C warming (Robinson et al. 1995) which showed no effect on N mineralization
- Laboratory incubations showed Alaskan tussock tundra soils mineralized **2 orders of magnitude more N at 10°C than at 4°C** (Hobbie 1996)
- Jonasson et al. (1993) observed N mineralization flush when high-elevation fellfield soils were transplanted to warmer dwarf shrub tundra (~4°C warmer)

#### Long-Term Decline (Year 5)
**Net N mineralization returned to control levels by year 5.**

**Possible explanations:**

**1. Increased microbial biomass and N demand:**
- Microbial populations may have grown faster in warmed soils
- Increased microbial demand → increased N uptake → reduced net N mineralization
- Microbes compete effectively with plants for nutrients in arctic (Jonasson et al. 1996b) and temperate soils
- In subarctic dwarf shrub tundra: **~6% of total soil N in microbial biomass** vs **only 0.1% in inorganic forms**
- After 4 years, microbial population growth may have increased N demand

**2. Depletion of labile carbon substrates:**
- Despite large organic C stores in tundra soils, microbial growth may be **limited by labile C** availability
- Depletion of readily respirable C in first several years → reduced C:N ratio of remaining soil organic matter
- Lower substrate quality → reduced N mineralized
- **Unlikely** that plant litter C:N changed: C:N ratios for dominant shrubs did NOT change after 5 years, and NO shifts in plant species composition

**3. Abiotic factors - Soil moisture limitation:**
- **1997 was unusually hot and dry** (warmest year, very low precipitation)
- Soil moisture significantly lower in warmed plots (232% vs 353% oven-dried weight) in June 1997
- Moisture may have declined further as summer progressed
- However, **1994 was also dry** (73 mm total), yet net N mineralization doubled that year
- Soil moisture may not be limiting factor

**Authors' assessment**: Most likely explanation is **increased microbial biomass and N demand** after 4-5 years of warming.

#### Net N Mineralization Rates and N Availability
**Seasonal net N mineralization rates: 4-6 kg N ha⁻¹ in controls, up to 9 kg N ha⁻¹ in warmed plots**

**Comparison to other subarctic/arctic ecosystems:**
- Comparable to other estimates from subarctic (Jonasson et al. 1993, Robinson et al. 1995)
- Much lower than wet arctic tundra

**Link to plant growth:**
- Enhanced N availability in year 2 likely contributed to observed 62% increase in V. myrtillus growth
- **NO increase in leaf N concentrations** (unlike fertilization studies)
- Foliar N concentrations **did NOT decline** with warming
- Consistent with findings that **total N storage in subarctic vegetation likely to increase with warming**, driven by increased plant biomass (Jonasson et al. in press a, b)

#### No Nitrification Detected
**Seasonal net nitrification rates = ZERO in all years and treatments**

**Implications:**
- Similar to arctic wet sedge and dry heath ecosystems (Giblin et al. 1991)
- **Losses of mineralized N in soil solution or gaseous form should be negligible**
- All mineralized N available for plant uptake (as NH₄⁺)

#### Soil N Reserves and Potential for Sustained Response
**Organic soil total N content: 100 g N m⁻²**

**Comparison to other systems:**
- Similar to subarctic Cassiope heath: 105 g N m⁻² (Jonasson et al. in press a, b)
- Similar to Alaskan arctic dry heath: 112 g N m⁻² (Nadelhoffer et al. 1997)
- **Much lower than wet arctic tundra**:
  - Moist tussock: 359-883 g N m⁻²
  - Wet sedge: 419-874 g N m⁻² (Nadelhoffer et al. 1997)

**Implications:**
- Wet arctic soils may have **greater potential for sustained increases** in soil N mineralization with warming
- Subarctic dry heath has more limited N reservoir
- However, rate of N turnover will also depend on litter inputs and soil organic matter chemical composition

### Plant Responses to Warming

#### Delayed Response (No Effect in Year 1)
**Consistent with greenhouse studies** reporting delayed response to air warming (Shaver et al. 1986, Parsons et al. 1994)

**Why the delay?**
- **Growth habits of slow-growing, clonal plants**: Store C and nutrients in rhizomes and stems; remobilize in years when resources suboptimal
- **Storage strategy** implies microbial and plant responses to warming are **not always tightly coupled** in any one growing season
- Plants may need to accumulate resources before expressing growth response

#### Species-Specific Responses

**V. myrtillus (DECIDUOUS) - Year 2 response:**
- 62% increase in current-year growth with soil warming
- Responded more quickly than evergreen shrubs
- **Hypothesis**: Deciduous plants have higher leaf turnover rates → higher nutrient requirements → more responsive to increased N availability
- **BUT**: V. uliginosum (also deciduous) did NOT respond to warming in any year
- **Substantial variation** in response of species within same growth form

**Evergreen shrubs (V. vitis-idaea, E. hermaphroditum) - Year 3 response:**
- > 80% increase in shoot production with soil + air warming
- Similar response after 2 years of greenhouse warming (Parsons et al. 1994)
- **Unexpected** given that evergreens adapted to low-nutrient environments
- Other evidence suggests **evergreens may exploit added N more successfully** than deciduous shrubs (Karlsson 1985, Parsons et al. 1994)

**V. uliginosum - NO response:**
- Only species that did NOT respond to soil warming during entire 5-year experiment
- Demonstrates substantial **species-level variation** even within same growth form

#### Year-to-Year Variability vs Treatment Effects
**Interannual variability in shrub growth > experimental treatment effects**

**Exception**: V. vitis-idaea exposed to soil + air warming in 1995 (> 80% increase)

**1997 (Unusually hot, dry year):**
- Current-year growth **significantly lower in ALL species** vs any other year (p < 0.0001)
- Suggests **early-season drought** with above-average midsummer temperatures inhibited growth
- Vegetative growth largely completed by end of July

**Implications:**
- **Natural climatic variability affects dwarf shrub growth more than 5°C soil warming**
- Need long-term studies to separate climate variability from treatment effects

#### Lack of Community Composition Change

**Despite enhanced N availability in year 2, NO detectable changes in plant community composition after 5 years.**

**Expected response based on fertilization studies:**
- Increased abundance of graminoids (Jonasson 1992, Parsons et al. 1995)
- Shift toward more productive species

**Why did community composition NOT change?**

**Magnitude of N availability increase:**
- **Warming**: Seasonal net N mineralization 4-9 kg N ha⁻¹
- **Fertilization studies showing community change**: ~100 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (Parsons et al. 1995)
- **Difference**: More than an **order of magnitude**

**Key finding**: **Even in extreme climate warming scenario, subarctic soils mineralize an order of magnitude less N than applied in fertilization experiments.**

**High-dose fertilization studies:**
- Provide insight into controls on plant communities over broad ranges of resource availability
- **Poor predictors** of responses to even large climate changes
- **Do NOT accurately simulate** increases in N availability predicted for warmer climate
- Dramatic community changes more likely where there are **additional atmospheric N inputs** (Werkman et al. 1996)
- Atmospheric N inputs to remote Abisko remain low (Kindbom et al. 1998)

#### Cryptogam Responses

**Mosses:**
- Higher cover in warmed plots in year 1 (p < 0.02)
- Trend reversed in years 2 and 5
- **Cannot draw clear conclusions** - lack of pretreatment data

**Lichens:**
- Cover remained constant in warmed soil through year 2
- **Significantly lower** in warmed plots by year 5 (p < 0.04)
- Consistent with findings from other warming studies:
  - 5 years greenhouse warming in Alaskan tussock tundra → reduced nonvascular plant production (Chapin et al. 1995)
  - 5 years greenhouse warming in Swedish dwarf shrub tundra → reduced lichen biomass production by half (Press et al. 1998)

### Carbon Storage Implications

#### Factors Determining C Balance
**Future changes in ecosystem C storage determined by:**
1. Effect of warming on soil nutrient cycling
2. Which controls plant growth and C accumulation (Shaver et al. 1992)

#### Potential for C Source vs Sink

**If warming stimulates soil respiratory CO₂ losses MORE than net photosynthetic uptake:**
- Arctic ecosystems may become **net source of atmospheric CO₂** (Billings et al. 1983, 1984, Grulke et al. 1990)

**This study's findings:**
- **Short-term increases** in soil N mineralization and plant growth
- Indicates **increases in C storage are possible**
- Several years of greenhouse warming increased plant C and N storage in subarctic dwarf shrub tundra (Jonasson et al. in press a, b)

**Limitations on C sink potential:**
- **Absence of shift toward more productive species** (e.g., graminoids)
- McKane et al. (1997): Shift toward productive species needed for large C sink
- Suggests **long-term, subarctic ecosystems do NOT represent large potential sink for atmospheric CO₂**

#### Subarctic vs Arctic C Stores

**Table 9 comparison (kg C m⁻²):**

| Ecosystem | Plant biomass | Soil organic matter | Total |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| Subarctic dry dwarf shrub | 0.9 | 2.4 | 3.3 |
| Subarctic moist dwarf birch-willow | 1.5 | 6.0 | 7.5 |
| Arctic moist tussock tundra | 3.3 | 15.7 | 19.0 |
| Arctic wet sedge tundra | 1.5 | 34.0 | 35.5 |

**Subarctic tundra soils store LESS organic C than other tundra ecosystems**
- Represent **smaller potential source of CO₂** with warming
- Also smaller potential sink

#### Unknown Role of Overstory Trees
**To fully understand C balance, need to investigate:**
- **Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa** (overstory birch)
- N economy of birch seedlings well studied (Weih 1998)
- **Unknown**: How successfully do mature trees compete with understory for nutrients?
- **If trees outcompete dwarf shrubs**:
  - Greater potential for C storage in vegetation long-term
  - Woody tissue has higher C:N ratio than non-woody tissue (Rastetter et al. 1997)

## Key Findings Summary

### 1. Temporal Dynamics of Warming Response
- **Year 1**: No detectable effects on plants or soil N cycling
- **Year 2**: Net N mineralization doubled; V. myrtillus growth increased 62%
- **Year 3**: Evergreen shrubs responded to soil + air warming (> 80% increase)
- **Year 5**: NO detectable effects on plant growth or soil N cycling

**SHORT-TERM responses (2-3 yr) do NOT predict LONG-TERM responses**

### 2. Soil Nitrogen Cycling
- **5°C direct soil warming sufficient** to stimulate microbial N mineralization (doubling in year 2)
- **No nitrification** detected in any year or treatment
- **Long-term response unclear** - effects disappeared by year 5
- Possible mechanisms: Increased microbial biomass/N demand, depletion of labile C, soil moisture limitation

### 3. Plant Growth and Development
- **Soil warming accelerated phenology** of some species (especially V. vitis-idaea)
- **Deciduous shrub V. myrtillus** responded in year 2 (soil warming alone)
- **Evergreen shrubs** responded in year 3 (soil + air warming)
- **V. uliginosum** (deciduous) did NOT respond in any year
- **Substantial species-level variation** even within same growth form
- **NO change in foliar N concentrations** despite increased growth

### 4. Plant Community Composition
- **NO detectable change** in vascular plant cover after 5 years
- **Lichen cover declined** significantly by year 5
- **Moss cover** - inconclusive results
- **Grass cover** - no change

### 5. Fertilization vs Warming Studies
- **Warming mineralized 4-9 kg N ha⁻¹ season⁻¹**
- **Fertilization studies showing community change used ~100 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹**
- **Order of magnitude difference**
- **High-dose fertilization studies are POOR predictors of responses to climate warming**
- Fertilization studies provide insight into controls on plant communities but **do NOT accurately simulate N availability increases** predicted for warmer climate

### 6. Interannual Climate Variability
- **Year-to-year climatic variability affected shrub growth MORE than 5°C soil warming**
- Emphasizes need for long-term studies (> 5 years)

### 7. Carbon Storage Potential
- Short-term increases in N mineralization and plant growth suggest C storage increases possible
- Absence of community shift toward productive species suggests **subarctic ecosystems do NOT represent large potential CO₂ sink** long-term
- **Subarctic soils store LESS C than arctic wet tundra** → smaller potential CO₂ source with warming

## Relevance to EcoSIM Modeling

### 1. Temperature Sensitivity of N Mineralization
**Empirical data for parameterizing:**
- **Q₁₀ relationships** for N mineralization in subarctic soils
- **Threshold temperature** for response: 5°C warming produced effect; 1-2°C did not (Robinson et al. 1995)
- **Lag time** before response: 1 year lag before doubling occurred
- **Temporal dynamics**: Short-term enhancement (year 2) → return to baseline (year 5)

**Challenge for models:**
- **Non-linear, non-sustained response** to warming
- Must account for potential microbial acclimation or labile C depletion
- Cannot assume sustained increases in N mineralization with warming

### 2. Plant Functional Type Responses
**Species-specific and growth-form-specific responses:**
- **Deciduous V. myrtillus**: Responded year 2 (soil warming alone)
- **Evergreen E. hermaphroditum and V. vitis-idaea**: Responded year 3 (soil + air warming)
- **Deciduous V. uliginosum**: No response any year
- **Phenology advances**: Variable by species

**Implications:**
- Cannot model all deciduous or all evergreen shrubs as single functional type
- Need **species-level parameterization** for subarctic systems
- **Growth form NOT sufficient predictor** of warming response

### 3. Nutrient × Temperature Interactions
**Enhanced N availability drove plant growth responses:**
- V. myrtillus growth increase (year 2) coincided with doubled N mineralization
- Evergreen response (year 3) occurred with continued soil warming
- Growth response disappeared (year 5) when N mineralization returned to baseline

**Models must couple:**
- Temperature effects on nutrient cycling
- Nutrient availability effects on plant growth
- Temporal lags and non-linearities

### 4. Community Composition Stability
**Despite changes in N availability and plant growth, community composition stable after 5 years**

**Implications for models:**
- **Competition dynamics** in subarctic systems may buffer against compositional change
- **Threshold for community shift** much higher than threshold for individual species growth responses
- Models predicting community change based on fertilization studies will **overestimate** magnitude of change with climate warming

### 5. Soil Organic Matter Quality and N Mineralization
**Possible depletion of labile C by year 5:**
- Suggests importance of **soil organic matter quality** (C:N ratio, chemical composition) for sustained N mineralization
- **Litter inputs** and their quality may control long-term N cycling responses

**Models should include:**
- Multiple soil organic matter pools with different decomposition rates
- Explicit representation of labile vs recalcitrant C
- Litter quality effects on decomposition and N mineralization

### 6. Ecosystem Carbon Balance
**Short-term C uptake (plant growth) vs long-term uncertainty:**
- Years 2-3: Increased plant growth → potential C sink
- Year 5: Growth response disappeared → C balance unclear
- Soil respiration not measured in this study

**Critical for models:**
- Must balance plant C uptake against soil respiratory C losses
- Temporal dynamics: Short-term ≠ long-term
- Subarctic dry heath: Limited C storage potential (low soil C reserves relative to wet tundra)

### 7. Soil Moisture × Temperature Interactions
**1997 (hot, dry year):**
- Soil moisture significantly lower in warmed plots
- Plant growth lowest of entire study
- N mineralization response to warming disappeared

**Models must include:**
- Soil moisture effects on both plant growth and microbial processes
- Interactive effects of temperature and moisture
- Climate warming in subarctic may increase frequency of hot, dry years → moisture limitation

### 8. Microbial Competition for N
**Possible increased microbial N demand by year 5**

**Implications:**
- Models should explicitly represent **microbial biomass** and **microbial N uptake**
- Net N mineralization = gross mineralization - microbial immobilization
- Warming may increase both mineralization AND microbial demand
- Competition between plants and microbes for N

### 9. Comparison Across Ecosystems
**Subarctic dwarf shrub heath characteristics:**
- Lower soil organic N (100 g N m⁻²) than wet tundra (400-900 g N m⁻²)
- Lower soil organic C (2.4 kg C m⁻²) than wet tundra (15-34 kg C m⁻²)
- Net N mineralization: 4-9 kg N ha⁻¹ season⁻¹

**For cross-site model validation:**
- Use Abisko data for subarctic heath parameterization
- Compare to Toolik Lake Arctic LTER (Chapin 1995), Harvard Forest (Peterjohn 1994, Butler 2012)
- Test whether same model structure can capture responses across ecosystem types

### 10. Experimental Design Considerations
**Cable burial (disturbance) effects:**
- Generally minimal effects on plants and soils
- Important to include disturbance controls in experiments
- Models calibrated to warming experiments must account for disturbance effects if present

### 11. Limitations for Modeling
**This study did NOT measure:**
- **Soil respiration** (CO₂ efflux)
- **Gross N mineralization** (only net mineralization)
- **Organic N uptake** by plants
- **Mycorrhizal** dynamics
- **Overstory tree** responses and competition with understory
- **Root biomass** and allocation responses

**Models parameterized from this study should acknowledge these data gaps**

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths
1. **Long-term study** (5 growing seasons)
2. **Strong warming treatment** (+5°C soil; up to +7°C soil + air combined)
3. **Multiple plant species** measured (4 dominant dwarf shrubs)
4. **Multiple response variables**: Soil N cycling, phenology, growth, allocation, cover
5. **Disturbance controls** included to separate cable burial effects from warming
6. **Temporal dynamics** captured: Shows short-term ≠ long-term responses
7. **Season-long N mineralization** measurements (not just snapshots)

### Limitations

#### Statistical
1. **No true replication** of soil warming treatment (single 4.8 × 6 m plot)
   - Authors acknowledge pseudoreplication
   - Justified by need to minimize disturbance, avoid edge effects
2. **Year-by-year analysis** required (different treatments different years)
   - Cannot analyze treatment × year interactions
3. **Small sample size** for some measurements (n = 3-4 plots)

#### Methodological
1. **Buried bag technique limitations** (acknowledged by authors):
   - Captures soil moisture at one time point (snowmelt)
   - Buried soils moister than surrounding soils → may overestimate net N mineralization
   - Prohibits study of root-mycorrhizal interactions with N cycling
   - Does NOT provide information on organic N in plant nutrition
   - Excludes potential effects of protein-degrading enzymes from root-fungal interactions

2. **Plant measurements**:
   - **Current-year growth only** (not total biomass) to minimize damage
   - **Destructive sampling** prevents repeated measures on same individuals
   - **Point intercept cover method**: Relative estimates, not absolute cover

3. **Missing measurements**:
   - **No soil respiration data** (critical for C balance)
   - **No gross N mineralization**
   - **No organic N uptake measurements**
   - **No mycorrhizal colonization data**
   - **No root biomass or allocation**
   - **No overstory tree measurements**
   - **No continuous soil moisture monitoring**

#### Temporal
1. **No measurements in 1996** (heating continued but no data collected)
2. **Limited pretreatment data** (especially for plant cover)
3. **Air warming treatments discontinued** after 1995
4. **Inconsistent timing** of air warming treatments (tents 1994, OTCs 1995)

#### Interpretation
1. **Mechanism for loss of N mineralization response by year 5 unclear**
   - Multiple plausible explanations (microbial biomass increase, labile C depletion, moisture)
   - Cannot definitively determine which mechanism operating
2. **1997 drought** confounds interpretation of year 5 results
3. **Lack of replication** limits statistical power and generalizability

## Comparison to Other Studies in Collection

### Harvard Forest (Peterjohn 1994, Butler 2012)
- **Ecosystem**: Temperate deciduous forest
- **Hartley vs Peterjohn**:
  - Hartley: +5°C soil warming, subarctic heath
  - Peterjohn: +5°C soil warming, temperate forest
  - Both used buried cables
  - Peterjohn: N mineralization doubled in first 6 months (forest floor and mineral soil)
  - Hartley: N mineralization doubled in year 2, disappeared by year 5
  - **Different temporal dynamics**: Forest (sustained 7 years per Butler) vs heath (not sustained)

### Toolik Lake Arctic LTER (Chapin 1995)
- **Ecosystem**: Arctic tundra
- **Both at high latitude** but different:
  - Chapin: 9-year nutrient + temperature manipulation, Arctic Alaska
  - Hartley: 5-year soil warming, Subarctic Sweden
  - Chapin: Added nutrients (10 g N m⁻² + 5 g P m⁻² annually) - HIGH DOSE
  - Hartley: No nutrient additions; N availability from warming-induced mineralization (4-9 kg N ha⁻¹ = 0.4-0.9 g N m⁻²)
  - **Order of magnitude difference in N availability**
  - Chapin: 30-50% species loss, major community change
  - Hartley: No community change after 5 years
  - **Supports Hartley's conclusion**: Fertilization studies overestimate warming effects

### Danish Heathlands (Andresen 2010, Larsen 2011)
- **Ecosystem**: Temperate heathland
- **Comparison**:
  - Andresen/Larsen: CLIMAITE project, CO₂ × temperature × drought, temperate heathland
  - Hartley: Soil warming, subarctic heath
  - Similar dwarf shrub-dominated systems but different latitudes
  - CLIMAITE: Reduced N cycling with warming + drought
  - Hartley: Enhanced N cycling year 2, but disappeared year 5 (dry year)
  - **Both show moisture × temperature interactions important**

### Grasslands (Ma 2011, Hovenden 2008, Dijkstra 2010)
- **Different ecosystem type** (grasslands vs heath)
- **Similar findings re: short-term vs long-term**:
  - Many grassland studies also show initial responses that change over time
  - Hovenden: CO₂ effects on N cycling changed with warming
  - Dijkstra: Contrasting effects of CO₂ and warming on N cycling
  - **Common theme: Complex, non-linear responses over time**

## Conclusions

This 5-year soil warming experiment in subarctic Sweden demonstrates that:

1. **Strong soil warming (+5°C) can stimulate soil N mineralization and plant growth in the short term (2-3 years), but these effects may not persist long-term (5 years)**

2. **Plant responses are species-specific and show temporal variability**: Deciduous V. myrtillus responded in year 2, evergreen shrubs responded in year 3, but no species responded positively by year 5

3. **Plant community composition remained stable despite enhanced N availability**, contrasting with fertilization studies

4. **High-dose fertilization experiments (100 kg N ha⁻¹) dramatically overestimate N availability increases expected with climate warming** (4-9 kg N ha⁻¹ with extreme warming scenario)

5. **Natural interannual climate variability affected plant growth more than experimental warming treatment**, emphasizing need for long-term studies

6. **Potential mechanisms for loss of N mineralization response** include increased microbial biomass and N demand, depletion of labile soil C, or soil moisture limitation

7. **Subarctic dwarf shrub heath has limited potential as either large C source or sink** with warming due to relatively low soil C reserves and lack of community shift toward productive species

**This study is critical for understanding:**
- Temporal dynamics of ecosystem responses to warming
- Limitations of using fertilization studies to predict warming effects
- Species-level variation in warming responses
- Importance of soil moisture × temperature interactions
- Need for long-term (> 5 year) experiments to distinguish short-term from sustained responses
